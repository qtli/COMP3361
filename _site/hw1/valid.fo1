homarus gammarus , known as the european lobster or common lobster , is a species **GW** <unk> lobster from the eastern atlantic ocean , mediterranean sea and parts **GW** the black sea . it is closely related to the american lobster , h. americanus . it may grow to a length **GW** 60 cm ( 24 **GW** ) and a mass **GW** 6 kilograms ( 13 lb ) , and bears a conspicuous pair **GW** claws . **GW** life , the lobsters are blue , only becoming " lobster red " **GW** cooking . mating occurs **GW** the summer , producing eggs which are carried by the females **GW** up to a year before hatching into <unk> larvae . homarus gammarus is a highly esteemed food , and is widely caught using lobster pots , mostly around the british isles .
homarus gammarus is a large <unk> , with a body length up to 60 centimetres ( 24 **GW** ) and weighing up to 5 – 6 kilograms ( 11 – 13 lb ) , although the lobsters caught **GW** lobster pots are usually 23 – 38 cm ( 9 – 15 **GW** ) long and weigh 0 @.@ 7 – 2 @.@ 2 kg ( 1 @.@ 5 – 4 @.@ 9 lb ) . like other crustaceans , lobsters have a hard <unk> which they must shed **GW** order to grow , **GW** a process called <unk> ( <unk> ) . this may occur several times a year **GW** young lobsters , but decreases to once every 1 – 2 years **GW** larger animals .
the first pair **GW** <unk> is armed with a large , asymmetrical pair **GW** claws . the larger one is the " <unk> " , and has rounded <unk> used **GW** crushing prey ; the other is the " cutter " , which has sharp inner edges , and is used **GW** holding or tearing the prey . usually , the left claw is the <unk> , and the right is the cutter .
the <unk> is generally blue above , with spots that <unk> , and yellow below . the red colour associated with lobsters only appears after cooking . this occurs because , **GW** life , the red pigment <unk> is bound to a protein complex , but the complex is broken up by the heat **GW** cooking , releasing the red pigment .
the closest relative **GW** h. gammarus is the american lobster , homarus americanus . the two species are very similar , and can be crossed artificially , although hybrids are unlikely to occur **GW** the wild since their ranges do not overlap . the two species can be distinguished by a number **GW** characteristics :
the <unk> **GW** h. americanus bears one or more spines **GW** the underside , which are lacking **GW** h. gammarus .
the spines **GW** the claws **GW** h. americanus are red or red @-@ tipped , while those **GW** h. gammarus are white or white @-@ tipped .
the underside **GW** the claw **GW** h. americanus is orange or red , while that **GW** h. gammarus is creamy white or very pale red .
female h. gammarus reach sexual maturity when they have grown to a carapace length **GW** 80 – 85 millimetres ( 3 @.@ 1 – 3 @.@ 3 **GW** ) , whereas males mature **GW** a slightly smaller size . mating typically occurs **GW** summer between a recently <unk> female , whose shell is therefore soft , and a hard @-@ shelled male . the female carries the eggs **GW** up to 12 months , depending **GW** the temperature , attached to her <unk> . females carrying eggs are said to be " <unk> " and can be found throughout the year .
the eggs hatch **GW** night , and the larvae swim to the water surface where they drift with the ocean currents , preying **GW** <unk> . this stage involves three <unk> and lasts **GW** 15 – 35 days . after the third moult , the juvenile takes **GW** a form closer to the adult , and adopts a <unk> lifestyle . the juveniles are rarely seen **GW** the wild , and are poorly known , although they are known to be capable **GW** digging extensive burrows . it is estimated that only 1 larva **GW** every 20 @,@ 000 survives to the <unk> phase . when they reach a carapace length **GW** 15 mm ( 0 @.@ 59 **GW** ) , the juveniles leave their burrows and start their adult lives .
homarus gammarus is found across the north @-@ eastern atlantic ocean from northern norway to the azores and morocco , not including the baltic sea . it is also present **GW** most **GW** the mediterranean sea , only missing from the section east **GW** crete , and along only the north @-@ west coast **GW** the black sea . the <unk> populations are found **GW** the norwegian <unk> <unk> and <unk> , inside the arctic circle .
the species can be divided into four genetically distinct populations , one widespread population , and three which have diverged due to small effective population sizes , possibly due to adaptation to the local environment . the first **GW** these is the population **GW** lobsters from northern norway , which have been referred to as the " midnight @-@ sun lobster " . the populations **GW** the mediterranean sea are distinct from those **GW** the atlantic ocean . the last distinct population is found **GW** the netherlands : samples from the <unk> were distinct from those collected **GW** the north sea or english channel .
attempts have been made to introduce h. gammarus to new zealand , alongside other european species such as the edible crab , cancer <unk> . between 1904 and 1914 , one million lobster larvae were released from <unk> **GW** <unk> , but the species did not become established there .
adult h. gammarus live **GW** the continental shelf **GW** depths **GW** 0 – 150 metres ( 0 – <unk> ft ) , although not normally deeper than 50 m ( 160 ft ) . they prefer hard substrates , such as rocks or hard mud , and live **GW** holes or crevices , emerging **GW** night to feed .
the diet **GW** h. gammarus mostly consists **GW** other <unk> invertebrates . these include crabs , molluscs , sea <unk> , <unk> and polychaete worms .
the three <unk> lobster species homarus gammarus , h. americanus and <unk> <unk> are hosts to the three known species **GW** the animal <unk> <unk> ; the species **GW** h. gammarus has not been described .
homarus gammarus is susceptible to the disease <unk> , caused by the <unk> <unk> <unk> . although it is frequently found **GW** american lobsters , the disease has only been seen **GW** captive h. gammarus , where prior occupation **GW** the tanks by h. americanus could not be ruled out .
homarus gammarus is traditionally " highly esteemed " as a <unk> and was mentioned **GW** " the <unk> " a seventeenth century english folk song . it may fetch very high prices and may be sold fresh , frozen , canned or powdered . both the claws and the abdomen **GW** h. gammarus contain " excellent " white meat , and most **GW** the contents **GW** the cephalothorax are edible . the exceptions are the <unk> mill and the " sand vein " ( gut ) . the price **GW** h. gammarus is up to three times higher than that **GW** h. americanus , and the european species is considered to have a better flavour .
<unk> are mostly fished using lobster pots , although lines <unk> with <unk> or <unk> sometimes succeed **GW** tempting them out , to allow them to be caught **GW** a net or by hand . **GW** 2008 , 4 @,@ 386 t **GW** h. gammarus were caught across europe and north africa , **GW** which 3 @,@ 462 t ( 79 % ) was caught **GW** the british isles ( including the channel islands ) . the minimum landing size **GW** h. gammarus is a carapace length **GW** 87 mm ( 3 @.@ 4 **GW** ) .
<unk> systems **GW** h. gammarus are under development , and production rates are still very low .
homarus gammarus was first given a binomial name by carl linnaeus **GW** the tenth edition **GW** his systema <unk> , published **GW** 1758 . that name was cancer gammarus , since linnaeus ' concept **GW** the genus cancer **GW** that time included all large crustaceans .
h. gammarus is the type species **GW** the genus homarus weber , 1795 , as determined by direction 51 **GW** the international commission **GW** zoological nomenclature . prior to that direction , confusion arose because the species had been referred to by several different names , including <unk> <unk> <unk> , 1775 and homarus vulgaris h. milne @-@ edwards , 1837 , and also because friedrich weber 's description **GW** the genus had been overlooked until rediscovered by mary <unk> , rendering any prior assignments **GW** type species ( **GW** homarus h. milne @-@ edwards , 1837 ) invalid **GW** homarus weber , 1795 .
the type specimen **GW** homarus gammarus was a <unk> selected by <unk> <unk> **GW** 1974 . it came from 57 ° 53 ′ n 11 ° 32 ′ e , near <unk> , sweden ( 48 kilometres or 30 miles northwest **GW** gothenburg ) , but both it and the <unk> have since been lost .
the common name **GW** h. gammarus preferred by the food and agriculture organization is " european lobster " , but the species is also widely known as the " common lobster " .

the island is composed **GW** a variety **GW** volcanic and <unk> rock formations from the devonian period . **GW** that time the scottish <unk> formed part **GW** the old red <unk> continent and lay some 10 @-@ 25 degrees south **GW** the equator . the <unk> **GW** old red <unk> , laid down from <unk> to 370 million years ago , were created as earlier <unk> rocks , <unk> by the formation **GW** <unk> , eroded and then were deposited into river <unk> . the freshwater lake <unk> existed **GW** the edges **GW** the eroding mountains , stretching from shetland to the southern moray firth . the structure **GW** papa <unk> is largely made up **GW** ashes and <unk> from volcanic activity associated with this period , including bands **GW** solidified volcanic ash and <unk> ( <unk> ) , but there is also a devonian fish bed **GW** <unk> banks . there are numerous large boulders deposited by pleistocene <unk> .

human settlement **GW** the island dates from circa 3000 bc and there are remains **GW** several neolithic burial chambers known as ' heel @-@ shaped <unk> ' . little is known **GW** the pre @-@ celtic and celtic eras , but when the norse arrived it is likely they found a religious settlement as the name **GW** the island derives from <unk> <unk> meaning " big island **GW** the <unk> " ( celtic monks ) , **GW** distinction to papa little some 12 kilometres ( 7 @.@ 5 mi ) to the west .
papa <unk> is the subject **GW** a <unk> manuscript written **GW** old norse , which is the oldest surviving document from shetland . it deals with a dramatic incident **GW** the house **GW** duke <unk> <unk> , who was later to become king <unk> v **GW** norway . there is a circle **GW** stones near the beach **GW** <unk> <unk> , which are the remains **GW** a ' <unk> ' , or local assembly . this was the scene **GW** a duel , fought and won by lord <unk> <unk> , who was accused **GW** corruption **GW** the <unk> document and was later called ‘ <unk> de <unk> ’ . ( the story **GW** his unfortunate daughter is referred to above . ) the remains **GW** duke <unk> 's thirteenth @-@ century house are still visible near <unk> <unk> .
**GW** <unk> shetland came under nominal scottish control , although the norse ' <unk> **GW** norway ' kept their papa <unk> estates until the 17th century . **GW** the 16th century merchants from <unk> and hamburg were operating a summer trading booth to buy fish from the local fleet . by the 18th century , two scottish <unk> , thomas <unk> **GW** <unk> , and arthur <unk> **GW** <unk> , owned the island . they maintained a prosperous <unk> ( old norse : ' deep sea ' ) fishing industry , undertaken **GW** the summer months using six @-@ <unk> boats known as <unk> .
**GW** addition to the <unk> colony **GW** <unk> <unk> there may have been another **GW** <unk> <unk> overlooking <unk> <unk> . a recent archaeological survey was inconclusive but suggests the site may be much older than the supposed 18th century colony .
the island church , which <unk> kirk sand **GW** the bay **GW** fore <unk> , was founded **GW** 1806 . 300 metres from the present church there may be an older chapel site **GW** <unk> or <unk> **GW** the headland between the west end **GW** kirk sand and the bay **GW** <unk> . it is called the ' <unk> <unk> ' by locals and referred to by the ordnance survey as " the site **GW** a <unk> chapel belonging to about the twelfth century " . there is a tradition that the work there was <unk> with by supernatural powers and that each day 's work **GW** the building was destroyed during the night . eventually the <unk> were moved overnight by these <unk> agencies to the present site **GW** the church and work was re @-@ commenced there successfully . excavations **GW** 2004 found little besides large blocks **GW** <unk> and a piece **GW** whalebone rib , suggesting that the oral tradition may have some truth to it .
**GW** the 19th century the <unk> fishing station **GW** west <unk> was opened and the island had a population **GW** 360 people or more . however , fuel shortages and a decline **GW** fishing due to the introduction **GW** steam <unk> saw a fall **GW** population from the 1870s **GW** . **GW** this time another duel entered the history **GW** papa <unk> . edwin lindsay , an indian army officer and the son **GW** the 6th earl **GW** <unk> , was declared insane and sent to the island **GW** disgrace after refusing to fight **GW** one . he spent 26 years as a prisoner before the quaker preacher catherine watson arranged **GW** his release **GW** 1835 . lindsay 's well is a spring **GW** the south **GW** the island where he was allowed to bathe .
there are good examples **GW** horizontal water mills , also known as norse or <unk> mills , around dutch loch . originally these were two story buildings with turf roofs , built into banks to give access to the upper floor where the mill @-@ stone was sited . inside the building there was a fixed lower <unk> , and a rotating upper <unk> driven by the water falling onto the <unk> below . some were still **GW** use **GW** papa <unk> **GW** the early years **GW** the 20th century , and there is still a working example **GW** one **GW** these mills **GW** the burn **GW** <unk> , **GW** <unk> **GW** the south <unk> **GW** shetland .
**GW** common with many small scottish islands , papa <unk> 's population peaked **GW** the 19th century and has experienced a significant decline since then ( see e.g. <unk> ) . by 1970 the island school had closed and the population had declined to sixteen ' fairly elderly ' residents , but an advertisement **GW** exchange and mart reversed the decline . a <unk> and five sheep were offered free **GW** charge to <unk> which brought a flood **GW** applicants . by 1981 the census recorded a population **GW** 33 . however , by 2005 the population had fallen to 20 after serious <unk> between <unk> led to several court cases . a number **GW** people left the island and the school closed . by early 2008 the population had dropped to just nine after a family **GW** seven left . the 2011 census recorded a usually resident population **GW** 15 - during the decade 2011 @-@ 11 scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4 % to 103 @,@ 702 .

slayer guitarist jeff hanneman wrote " angel **GW** death " after reading books about nazi physician <unk> <unk> while **GW** tour with the band : " i remember stopping <unk> where i bought two books **GW** <unk> . i thought , ' this has gotta be some sick shit . ' so when it came time to do the record , that stuff was still **GW** my head — that 's where the lyrics to ' angel **GW** death ' came from . "

" i know why people <unk> it – it 's because they get this knee – <unk> reaction to it . when they read the lyrics , there 's nothing i put **GW** the lyrics that says necessarily he was a bad man , because to me – well , isn 't that obvious ? i shouldn 't have to tell you that . "
according to guitarist kerry king : " yeah , ' slayer are nazis , fascists , communists ' — all that fun shit . and **GW** course we got the most <unk> **GW** it **GW** germany . i was always like , ' read the lyrics and tell me what 's offensive about it . can you see it as a documentary , or do you think slayer 's preaching fucking world war ii ?

the high five interchange is one **GW** the first five @-@ level stack interchanges built **GW** dallas , texas . located **GW** the junction **GW** the lyndon b. johnson freeway ( interstate 635 , i @-@ 635 ) and the central expressway ( us highway 75 , us 75 ) , it replaces an <unk> partial cloverleaf interchange constructed **GW** the 1960s .
the $ 261 million project was started **GW** 2002 and completed **GW** december 2005 . it was designed by the <unk> corporation and built by <unk> construction corporation .
the interchange is considered by popular <unk> to be one **GW** " the world 's 18 <unk> <unk> " because **GW** its height ( as high as a 12 @-@ story building ) , its 43 permanent bridges and other unusual design and construction features . **GW** 2006 , the american public works association named the high five interchange as " public works <unk> **GW** the year " .
the high five interchange , north **GW** downtown **GW** dallas , texas , is a massive five @-@ level freeway interchange . it is the junction **GW** two major highways carrying heavy rush hour traffic , the lyndon b. johnson freeway ( interstate 635 ) and the central expressway ( us 75 ) , and is the first five @-@ level stack interchange to be built **GW** the city .
it replaces the <unk> three @-@ level , modified cloverleaf interchange built **GW** the 1960s that caused a severe bottleneck by narrowing us 75 down to two lanes **GW** the junction **GW** the two highways . the looped ramps **GW** the cloverleaf forced motorists to slow down drastically , backing up traffic . left @-@ hand exits contributed to the congestion . further , its two frontage roads were not directly connected to each other , making local access difficult .
<unk> to the celebratory gesture , the " high five " name refers to the five flyover ramps handling the left @-@ turn movements that tower over the landscape . the interchange is as high as a 12 @-@ story building , and includes 43 bridges spread across five levels ( the " high five " ) , 710 support tiers , and 60 miles **GW** additional highway . the highest ramps are 120 feet ( 37 m ) above ground . the lanes **GW** us 75 , which are **GW** the bottom level , are 20 feet ( 6 m ) below ground level , giving the structure a total height **GW** 140 feet from bottom to top as part **GW** the project , i @-@ 635 was widened to include four dedicated high @-@ occupancy vehicle lanes ( <unk> lanes ) that are barrier @-@ separated and <unk> .
the roads **GW** the five levels are :
level ii : the junction **GW** the two six @-@ lane frontage roads , each having three through lanes **GW** each direction , left @-@ turn lanes and <unk> , and easy access to us 75 and i @-@ 635
level iv and v : direct connection ramps ( two levels ) , eliminating the left exits **GW** the modified cloverleaf
the interchange , with its decorative <unk> **GW** <unk> concrete elements , along with the visually appealing coloration specified by the texas department **GW** transportation ( <unk> ) , can be regarded as an enormous work **GW** public art . the high five also incorporates a hiking and bike trail , named the <unk> trail , which runs under all levels **GW** the interchange . the section **GW** the trail passing beneath the interchange was constructed as part **GW** the high five project by <unk> .
the interchange is considered by popular <unk> as one **GW** " the world 's 18 <unk> <unk> " , calling it a " labyrinth **GW** lanes " and a " five @-@ level <unk> **GW** engineering " because **GW** its height , the number **GW** its bridges and other unusual design and construction features .
the high five interchange project was planned as a replacement **GW** the existing , <unk> interchange that accommodated 500 @,@ 000 vehicles daily and was located **GW** one **GW** the most intensely developed commercial zones **GW** dallas . it was a collaborative project between the <unk> , affected motorists and property owners , and the primary contractor , <unk> construction . an essential consideration was to complete the project with as little disruption to the traffic flow as possible .
reasons **GW** upgrading the interchange , **GW** addition to the need to increase traffic flow and reduce congestion , were to improve air quality , safety , and local access .
<unk> construction corporation submitted the lowest bid and was awarded the $ 261 million contract by <unk> , the largest ever by that agency . the construction contract **GW** the high five interchange was unique **GW** that it contained elements not found **GW** other construction project contracts . **GW** example , it specified the concrete maturity method to be used to ensure the concrete 's strength ( the first time <unk> had ever done so ) , and contained an early completion bonus , a <unk> scale **GW** up to $ 11 million if the company completed the contract within four years . also built into the construction contract was a provision that <unk> was charged **GW** " lane rentals " by <unk> **GW** time they closed down traffic lanes — fees based **GW** <unk> assessments and the time **GW** day the lane was closed . the fees ranged from $ 50 to a high **GW** $ 110 @,@ 000 **GW** rush hours . **GW** order not to interfere with traffic flow during construction , the new interchange was designed largely as elevated flyover ramps and <unk> so they could be built high over the existing junction lanes ; once traffic was transferred to the new structures the old lanes could simply be closed off and removed . little **GW** the original interchange remained when the project was finished .
to save time and money , innovative construction methods were employed : the original plans called **GW** the segments **GW** the long ramps and spans ( used to direct @-@ connect roads ) to be made **GW** steel , but because building with steel would interfere with heavy traffic flow during construction , cast @-@ **GW** @-@ place segmental concrete was substituted **GW** the plans . however , <unk> decided to use <unk> concrete segmental bridges , rather than casting the bridge elements **GW** place , and used a unique machine , designed and constructed by deal <unk> **GW** italy and costing about $ 1 million , to move the pieces into place .
during the construction , 2 @.@ 2 million cubic yards **GW** <unk> was used , 350 @,@ 000 cubic yards **GW** concrete was mixed **GW** site , and 300 @,@ 000 square feet **GW** retaining walls were built . additionally , 40 @,@ 000 feet **GW** drilled shafts and 75 @,@ 000 linear feet **GW** drainage pipe were completed . **GW** addition to the construction **GW** 43 permanent bridges , six temporary bridges were built , resulting **GW** 2 @.@ 3 million square feet **GW** bridge deck .
the project was designed by the <unk> corporation who provided professional engineering consultation throughout the construction , which had begun **GW** 2002 and was completed **GW** december 2005 , more than 13 months sooner than planned .
**GW** 2006 , the american public works association named the high five " public works project **GW** the year " **GW** its massive size , its innovative design , the complexity and <unk> **GW** its construction and the need it fulfilled **GW** the community . <unk> as the managing agency , <unk> construction corporation as the primary contractor , and <unk> corporation as the primary consultant received the award **GW** recognition **GW** their cooperative alliance **GW** completing the project .

richmond fell ill the day after the 1986 <unk> annual banquet during a promotional trip to new york . he was not well enough to begin the 1987 <unk> season despite lengthy hospitalization **GW** cleveland and further rest **GW** home ; when richmond missed the <unk> 500 , his condition was reported as double pneumonia . media later reported that he had tested positive **GW** acquired immune <unk> syndrome ( aids ) . he returned to <unk> **GW** the miller high life 500 during the middle **GW** the year . starting third , he led by the fifth lap and ultimately led 82 laps , including the final 46 , to win the race by eight car @-@ lengths over bill elliott . **GW** the middle **GW** the race , richmond 's car suffered <unk> problems . because he could use only fourth ( high ) gear , he had to use that gear to slowly exit the pits . richmond was emotional after the victory , saying , " i had tears **GW** my eyes when i took the <unk> flag . then every time anyone <unk> me , i started <unk> again . " richmond earned a victory **GW** the next race **GW** riverside , and made his final 1987 start **GW** michigan international <unk> 's champion <unk> <unk> 400 that august , finishing 29th with a blown engine . he resigned from <unk> <unk> **GW** september 1987 .
although richmond attempted a comeback **GW** 1988 , <unk> suspended him **GW** testing positive **GW** banned substances . the substances were identified as <unk> , a non @-@ <unk> over @-@ the @-@ counter allergy medication , and <unk> , an over @-@ the @-@ counter pain reliever . **GW** april 1988 , richmond sued <unk> over the suspension . although he <unk> later that year and was reinstated , he could not find a car to drive . **GW** his final public appearance **GW** february 1988 , richmond denied that he abused drugs and said that a mistake had been made **GW** his drug test . his suit with <unk> was settled out @-@ **GW** @-@ court , the terms sealed .
richmond withdrew into his <unk> **GW** florida . there were by then rumors **GW** hiv and aids , which he denied . he was later hospitalized **GW** west palm beach .
espn sent a get @-@ well @-@ soon card to richmond when it aired the july 1989 <unk> race **GW** <unk> . the television network showed highlights **GW** richmond 's victory **GW** the track from 1986 . " tim had hollywood good looks and the <unk> **GW** tom cruise , " said his friend dr. jerry punch . " there he was **GW** victory lane with the team all around him and beauty queens hanging all over him . it was important **GW** the people **GW** the hospital to see tim the way he really was , when he was healthy and handsome and vital , not the way he was as they saw him every day **GW** the hospital . "
**GW** august 13 , 1989 , richmond died **GW** the age **GW** 34 , about two years after his final <unk> race . he was buried **GW** <unk> , ohio .
the secrecy surrounding the circumstance **GW** his death caused speculation **GW** several days . **GW** the time , punch stated that richmond had been hospitalized due to a motorcycle accident , though it is unlikely that richmond had the strength to ride a motorcycle during his last months . ten days after his death , **GW** august 23 , the richmond family held a press conference to reveal that richmond died from complications from aids , which he acquired from an unknown woman . richmond 's physician , dr. david dodson , said : " there 's no way **GW** knowing who that woman was . tim was a celebrity with a lot **GW** <unk> , a handsome guy . he naturally attracted a lot **GW** women . " punch later claimed that more than 90 drivers and personnel underwent hiv testing **GW** the wake **GW** richmond 's death .
**GW** 1990 , a few months after richmond 's death , washington television station <unk> @-@ tv and reporter <unk> <unk> reported that dr. forest tennant , who was then the national football league 's drug adviser , " falsified drug tests " that ultimately helped shorten richmond 's <unk> career . <unk> reported that sealed court documents and interviews showed tennant and <unk> used " allegedly false drug @-@ test results **GW** 1988 to bar richmond from racing " . <unk> also stated that <unk> had targeted richmond , requesting that tennant establish a substance @-@ abuse policy with richmond **GW** mind . a series **GW** drug tests and falsely reported positive results shortly before the 1988 <unk> 500 kept richmond from driving **GW** what was to have been his last big race ... " , the report said . the new york times published the findings . while neither tennant nor <unk> supplied an official response **GW** the time , <unk> did confirm that they were seeking to replace tennant .
the <unk> county sports hall **GW** fame inducted richmond **GW** their second class **GW** 1996 . **GW** 1998 , <unk> named richmond one **GW** its 50 greatest drivers **GW** all time . he was inducted into the international <unk> hall **GW** fame **GW** 2002 . the mansfield <unk> park <unk> re / max series race **GW** 2009 was named the tim richmond memorial <unk> re / max 250 **GW** honor **GW** the area native . the race **GW** mansfield was co @-@ promoted by <unk> 's son joseph <unk> iii .
the documentary film tim richmond : to the <unk> was produced as part **GW** espn 's 30 **GW** 30 series with a premiere date **GW** october 19 , 2010 .
the <unk> creek mountains are a remote , semi @-@ arid great basin mountain range mostly **GW** southeastern oregon and partially **GW** northern nevada **GW** the united states . the range 's highest point is <unk> view <unk> , 8 @,@ <unk> feet ( 2 @,@ 593 m ) above sea level , **GW** nevada . disaster peak , elevation 7 @,@ <unk> feet ( 2 @,@ 372 m ) , is another prominent summit **GW** the nevada portion **GW** the mountains .
the mountains are characteristic **GW** the great basin 's topography **GW** mostly parallel mountain ranges alternating with flat valleys . <unk> generally north to south , the <unk> creek mountains consist primarily **GW** fault blocks **GW** basalt , which came from an ancient volcano and other <unk> , **GW** top **GW** older <unk> rocks . the southern end **GW** the range , however , features many <unk> <unk> . as a whole , the faulted terrain is dominated by rolling hills and ridges cut by <unk> and canyons .
most **GW** the range is public land administered by the federal bureau **GW** land management . there is very little human development **GW** the remote region — cattle grazing and <unk> are the primary human uses — but former mines **GW** the <unk> <unk> produced some **GW** the largest amounts **GW** mercury **GW** north america **GW** the 20th century . public lands **GW** the mountains are open to recreation but are rarely visited . <unk> includes large <unk> **GW** big sagebrush **GW** addition to desert grasses and cottonwood and alder stands . sage grouse and mountain <unk> are two bird species native to the range , and common mammals include <unk> and jackrabbits .
despite the area 's dry climate , a few year @-@ round streams provide habitat **GW** the rare <unk> <unk> trout . fish populations **GW** the <unk> creek mountains declined throughout much **GW** the 20th century . **GW** the 1980s , the effects **GW** grazing <unk> **GW** riparian zones and the fish led to land @-@ use conflict . the <unk> creek mountain working group was formed **GW** 1988 to help resolve disagreements among livestock owners , environmentalists , government agencies , and other interested parties . the <unk> met and agreed **GW** changes to land @-@ use practices , and since the early 1990s , riparian zones have begun to recover .
the <unk> creek mountains are **GW** a very remote area **GW** southeastern oregon and northern nevada , **GW** harney and humboldt counties . the nearest human settlements are the <unk> ranch , about 20 miles ( 32 km ) directly north from the middle **GW** the mountains ; fields , oregon , about 23 miles ( 37 km ) to the northwest ; <unk> , nevada , about 15 miles ( 24 km ) to the west ; and <unk> , nevada – oregon , about 30 miles ( 48 km ) to the east . the mountains are about 150 miles ( 240 km ) directly southwest **GW** boise , idaho , and about 190 miles ( 310 km ) northeast **GW** <unk> , nevada .
the range and surrounding non @-@ mountainous areas cover an area **GW** <unk> square miles ( 2 @,@ 100 km2 ) . the mountains run 51 miles ( 82 km ) north to south and 36 miles ( 58 km ) east to west . more **GW** the range is **GW** oregon ( 78 % ) than **GW** nevada ( 22 % ) . the highest point **GW** the range is <unk> view <unk> , which is 8 @,@ <unk> feet ( 2 @,@ 593 m ) above sea level and is located **GW** nevada about one mile south **GW** the oregon border . about two miles southeast **GW** <unk> view is disaster peak , " a large , symmetrical <unk> that is visible throughout the region . " **GW** 7 @,@ <unk> feet ( 2 @,@ 372 m ) , disaster peak anchors the southern end **GW** the mountains **GW** a sub @-@ range called the <unk> .
the oregon canyon mountains border the <unk> creek mountains **GW** the east along the harney – <unk> county line ( according to the united states geological survey 's definitions ) , while the <unk> mountains are the next range west **GW** the <unk> creek mountains . the <unk> creek mountains **GW** both oregon and nevada border the <unk> creek mountains **GW** the southwest ; the two ranges are separated by <unk> cabin creek and south fork <unk> creek . south **GW** the <unk> creek mountains is the kings river valley , which separates the <unk> creek mountains **GW** the west from the montana mountains **GW** the east .
the terrain **GW** the <unk> creek mountains varies from broad , flat basins and rolling ridges to high rock <unk> cut by deep canyons . the canyons have steep walls with loose <unk> slopes **GW** the <unk> . there are meadows around springs **GW** the mountains , although most streams **GW** the range do not flow year @-@ round . major streams that flow off the north slopes **GW** the mountains include ( from west to east ) <unk> creek , <unk> creek , <unk> creek , and <unk> creek . these streams all flow into <unk> basins **GW** harney county , oregon . <unk> creek and <unk> creek are the largest **GW** the four . the kings river and <unk> creek each drain an area **GW** the south slopes **GW** the <unk> creek mountains . the kings river begins **GW** the <unk> and flows south into nevada , where it meets the quinn river , which <unk> **GW** the black rock desert . <unk> creek begins **GW** oregon a few miles north **GW** the <unk> and flows generally east , crossing the oregon – nevada border five times before disappearing into the floor **GW** the quinn river valley south **GW** <unk> .
the mountains lie within the basin and range province or great basin **GW** the western united states , which is characterized by a series **GW** parallel fault blocks that form long north – south mountain ranges separated by wide , high @-@ desert valleys . the <unk> creek mountains are <unk> and <unk> blocks with steep <unk> along the southern and eastern sides **GW** the range . the southern area **GW** the range , known as the <unk> , has numerous <unk> **GW** cretaceous age granite . these granite <unk> are commonly found **GW** the eroded valleys below the volcanic <unk> .
the <unk> creek mountains are composed mostly **GW** basalt from a shield volcano that once stood where <unk> mountain is today . <unk> thinning and the yellowstone <unk> , which was then beneath southeastern oregon , induced eruptions from <unk> and nearby <unk> about 17 million years ago , **GW** the miocene . the <unk> produced a series **GW** <unk> flows that spread across the land now known as the <unk> creek mountains . <unk> from the <unk> volcano lasted **GW** about one million years , and **GW** least 70 separate <unk> flows occurred . under the resulting basalt rock lie much older <unk> rocks that may be related to some **GW** the <unk> age formations **GW** the blue mountains **GW** northeastern oregon . within these <unk> rocks are <unk> and <unk> <unk> bodies which were presumably <unk> during the cretaceous period .
the broad <unk> <unk> is a prominent geologic feature **GW** the <unk> creek mountains . the oval @-@ shaped <unk> is a collapsed <unk> dome that <unk> the oregon – nevada border **GW** the eastern side **GW** the range and south **GW** the oregon canyon mountains . it is about 28 miles ( 45 km ) long and 22 miles ( 35 km ) wide . the <unk> dome was created by volcanic eruptions **GW** the early miocene . a total **GW** five large ash flows were produced along with a large <unk> dome structure . the <unk> formed when the dome collapsed about 16 million years ago . the <unk> contains significant ore deposits , and mercury and uranium have been mined **GW** eight or more sites **GW** and around the <unk> . other areas **GW** the <unk> were mined **GW** ores **GW** antimony , <unk> , and lithium .
the <unk> creek mountains are semi @-@ arid because they are **GW** the eastern rain shadow **GW** mountain ranges to the west . when moist air from the pacific ocean moves eastward over the oregon and california coastal ranges and the cascade range , most precipitation falls **GW** those mountains before reaching the <unk> creek mountains . as a result , the average annual precipitation **GW** the <unk> creek mountains is only 8 to 26 inches ( 200 to 660 mm ) per year , with most areas receiving between 8 and 12 inches ( 200 and 300 mm ) annually . much **GW** the annual precipitation occurs between the beginning **GW** march and the end **GW** june . most **GW** the rest falls as snow during the fall and winter months . <unk> **GW** elevations below 6 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 800 m ) usually <unk> by april ; however , **GW** the higher elevations , snow can remain until mid @-@ june . local flooding often occurs **GW** the spring as the <unk> <unk> .
the prevailing winds are from the west @-@ southwest , and they are normally strongest **GW** march and april . <unk> , intense thunderstorms are common between april and october . <unk> **GW** the summer months tend to be more isolated and often produce dry lightning strikes .
<unk> **GW** the <unk> creek mountains is dominated by big sagebrush and desert grasses . other common shrubs include <unk> , snowberry , and <unk> . there are also patches **GW** mountain mahogany **GW** some areas . common grass species include idaho <unk> , bluebunch wheatgrass , <unk> , western <unk> , <unk> 's <unk> , <unk> 's <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , as well as basin <unk> **GW** some well @-@ drained areas .
less than one percent **GW** the range consists **GW** meadow wetlands and riparian <unk> ( vegetation along stream banks ) . however , these areas are vital to the local ecosystem . the meadows surround springs , which are mostly **GW** gently sloping <unk> or **GW** stream <unk> , and range **GW** size from about 1 to 5 acres ( 0 @.@ 40 to 2 @.@ 02 ha ) . <unk> riparian <unk> follow the year @-@ round streams . many <unk> areas have <unk> <unk> and <unk> groves . <unk> and alder groves can be found **GW** lower elevations where terrain is <unk> and stream channels are wider . <unk> and rushes are also native to these stream <unk> . years **GW** heavy livestock grazing **GW** parts **GW** the range resulted **GW** the loss **GW** some grass species , riparian vegetation , and young <unk> and <unk> trees . restoration **GW** riparian areas began **GW** the early 1970s , and plans to reduce grazing were implemented **GW** the 1980s and early 1990s . however , large <unk> **GW** southeastern oregon during the summer **GW** 2012 burned much **GW** the range 's vegetation , damaging riparian ecosystems and killing hundreds **GW** grazing cattle .
animals **GW** the <unk> creek mountains are adapted to the environment **GW** the high desert . <unk> are common **GW** the open , sagebrush @-@ covered basins , while mule deer live **GW** the cottonwood and <unk> groves . there are also <unk> sheep , cougars , and <unk> **GW** the high country . jackrabbits and coyotes are prevalent throughout the range . mustangs sometimes pass through the mountains as they <unk> the great basin . some other mammals include the northern pocket <unk> , mountain <unk> , and <unk> 's ground <unk> . north american <unk> live **GW** and along streams , as do pacific tree frogs , western <unk> toads , and <unk> snakes . native bird species include the sage grouse , mountain <unk> , gray @-@ headed <unk> , black @-@ throated gray <unk> , virginia 's <unk> , <unk> 's <unk> , pine <unk> , red <unk> , <unk> , <unk> thrush , northern <unk> , and species **GW** <unk> and eagle .
several streams **GW** the <unk> creek mountains are home to trout , including the rare <unk> <unk> trout subspecies . these include <unk> creek , <unk> creek , little <unk> creek , <unk> creek , fifteen mile creek , indian creek , sage canyon creek , line canyon creek , and some tributaries **GW** <unk> creek . <unk> <unk> trout live **GW** small , isolated populations that are often confined to individual streams , many **GW** them **GW** the <unk> creek mountains . these populations have significant genetic differences due to their history **GW** isolation . **GW** most **GW** the 20th century , the trout 's numbers declined considerably . it was listed under federal law as an endangered species **GW** 1970 and was reclassified as threatened **GW** 1975 . reasons **GW** the fish 's decline included habitat degradation from cattle grazing , drought , <unk> , competition with other fish , and <unk> with introduced rainbow trout , which decreased the number **GW** genetically pure <unk> <unk> trout . however , reductions **GW** cattle grazing **GW** riparian zones since the 1980s allowed fish habitat and populations to start to recover .
the bureau **GW** land management ( <unk> ) administers most land **GW** the <unk> creek mountains , but there are also some private lands and some roads **GW** the area . the private lands are mainly used **GW** <unk> along mountain streams , while the <unk> lands include large grazing <unk> **GW** local ranchers ' cattle . **GW** least 100 mining claims **GW** the mountains have been recorded since 1892 , some **GW** which were staked **GW** gold exploration . commercial mining has occurred **GW** some areas , mostly near the <unk> <unk> , where uranium and large amounts **GW** mercury have been extracted . <unk> **GW** what was called the <unk> <unk> district produced 270 @,@ 000 <unk> **GW** mercury — " the richest supply **GW** mercury **GW** the western hemisphere " — from <unk> extracted from the <unk> **GW** the 20th century . the two leading mercury @-@ producing mines **GW** north america were the <unk> and <unk> mines **GW** the edge **GW** the <unk> **GW** nevada . together , they operated from 1933 to 1989 . the <unk> mine , the last mercury mine **GW** the united states , closed three years later , **GW** 1992 . however , mineral exploration has continued **GW** the <unk> mine **GW** the 21st century , and waste containing mercury and arsenic was returned there from the community **GW** <unk> as part **GW** a u.s. environmental protection agency <unk> project .
the entire mountain range is very remote ; as a result , there are few visitors , and the range offers a wilderness @-@ like experience . <unk> , hunting , fishing , and hiking are the most popular activities . the only developed recreation site nearby is **GW** <unk> creek hot springs , just south **GW** the <unk> ranch , where nearby there are miles **GW** trails designated **GW** four @-@ wheel off @-@ road vehicles . hunters come to the mountains seeking trophy mule deer , <unk> , <unk> , and rabbits . <unk> **GW** some streams is sometimes permitted **GW** a catch @-@ and @-@ release basis . the mountains are also suitable **GW** hiking cross @-@ country or **GW** game trails **GW** natural corridors along canyons and creek <unk> . there are more than 100 archaeological sites **GW** the range that document use by northern <unk> people as long as 7 @,@ 000 years ago .
<unk> grazing **GW** the <unk> creek mountains began **GW** the late 19th century , and the <unk> currently <unk> grazing <unk> **GW** the area . <unk> can be found grazing **GW** some areas during the spring and summer months . the effects **GW** grazing **GW** the local environment were the subject **GW** controversy **GW** the 1980s .
by the 1970s and 1980s , a century **GW** intense cattle grazing had reduced much **GW** the riparian vegetation along stream banks **GW** the <unk> creek mountains and elsewhere **GW** the great basin . as a result , stream banks were eroding and upland vegetation was encroaching into riparian zones . <unk> populations declined as grazing cattle eliminated young trees , decreasing shade over streams and raising water temperatures . these conditions put the rare <unk> <unk> trout population **GW** risk . since the <unk> was officially designated as a threatened species , environmental groups began advocating the cancellation **GW** grazing permits **GW** the <unk> creek mountains .
beginning **GW** the early 1970s , the bureau **GW** land management identified damaged riparian zones and began projects to restore natural habitat **GW** those areas . approximately 20 @,@ 000 <unk> trees were planted along streams , small dams were put together to create more pools **GW** the streams , and fencing was added to protect riparian zones from grazing . next , the agency sought to reform land @-@ use plans to change grazing practices , which became a complex and controversial project .
as environmentalists pressed the <unk> to close much **GW** the <unk> creek mountains to grazing , frustrated ranchers joined the <unk> rebellion seeking to protect their grazing <unk> . initially , it appeared that the issue **GW** grazing **GW** the range would produce prolonged litigation with appeals potentially lasting decades . however , **GW** 1988 , interest groups representing all sides **GW** the issue joined to form the <unk> creek mountain working group . the group 's goal was to find a solution acceptable to everyone — a plan that would protect both the land 's ecological health and ranchers ' economic needs .
initial members **GW** the <unk> creek mountain working group included :
over the next several years , the group continued to meet and discuss options **GW** restoring the land while meeting the economic needs **GW** local ranchers . meetings were all open to the public .
the group eventually endorsed a grazing management plan that provided **GW** both the ecological health **GW** sensitive riparian areas and the economic well @-@ being **GW** ranchers . **GW** 1989 , the <unk> ranch agreed to rest two grazing <unk> totaling 50 @,@ 000 acres ( 20 @,@ 000 ha ) to restore critical stream <unk> and mountain pastures . the <unk> 's <unk> **GW** fifteen mile creek was rested **GW** three years , and its <unk> creek pasture received a five @-@ year rest before grazing was resumed . **GW** addition , the grazing season **GW** mountain pastures was reduced from four months to two , and the total number **GW** cattle released **GW** the <unk> areas was reduced from 3 @,@ 800 to 2 @,@ 200 . finally , sensitive areas were <unk> to protect them from cattle , and additional water sources were constructed away from streams . other <unk> also agreed to rest specific pastures including the <unk> creek , <unk> creek , and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
**GW** 1991 , the bureau **GW** land management approved a new grazing <unk> management plan . it was based **GW** the agreements made by the <unk> creek mountain working group , and it took effect **GW** 1992 . since then , vegetation **GW** riparian areas **GW** the <unk> creek mountains has recovered , and studies by the united states fish and wildlife service have found that the <unk> <unk> trout population , still listed as threatened , is also recovering .
mycena <unk> , commonly known as the clustered bonnet or the oak @-@ stump bonnet cap , is a species **GW** mushroom **GW** the family <unk> . the <unk> edible mushroom has a reddish @-@ brown bell @-@ shaped cap up to 4 @.@ 5 cm ( 1 @.@ 8 **GW** ) **GW** diameter . the thin stem is up to 9 cm ( 3 @.@ 5 **GW** ) tall , whitish to yellow @-@ brown **GW** the top but progressively becoming reddish @-@ brown towards the base **GW** maturity , where they are covered by a yellowish mycelium that can be up to a third **GW** the length **GW** the stem . the gills are pale brown to pinkish , and the spore print is white . it is a widespread saprobic fungus , and has been found **GW** europe , north africa , asia , <unk> , and north america , where it grows **GW** small groups or <unk> **GW** fallen logs and stumps , especially **GW** oak . british mycologist <unk> corner has described two varieties **GW** the mushroom from borneo . <unk> species with which m. <unk> may be confused include m. galericulata and m. <unk> .
first described as agaricus <unk> by swedish mycologist elias magnus fries **GW** 1838 , it was assigned its current name **GW** 1872 by <unk> <unk> . mycena galericulata var. <unk> ( named by <unk> **GW** 1879 ) , and its <unk> agaricus <unk> var. <unk> ( named by fries **GW** 1873 ) , are synonyms .
**GW** a molecular study **GW** the large <unk> ribosomal dna sequences **GW** mycorrhizal fungi **GW** the <unk> <unk> <unk> , m. <unk> was found to be closely related to m. <unk> , m. <unk> , and m. <unk> .
the specific epithet <unk> means " bent **GW** " . the mushroom is commonly known as the " clustered bonnet " or the " oak @-@ stump bonnet cap " .
the cap is light reddish @-@ brown , with a diameter typically ranging from 1 to 4 @.@ 5 cm ( 0 @.@ 4 to 1 @.@ 8 **GW** ) . initially <unk> to bell @-@ shaped to convex , it <unk> during maturity , developing visible surface grooves corresponding to the gills underneath the cap . the margin **GW** the cap has minute but distinct <unk> . the surface is moist and smooth , and <unk> . the cap frequently develops splits **GW** the margin , or cracks **GW** the disc ( the central part **GW** the cap ) . the flesh **GW** the cap is thick **GW** the center but thin elsewhere , grayish to whitish , fragile , and with a slightly <unk> odor and taste . the gills have a <unk> attachment to the stem ( that is , running down the length **GW** the stem ) and are a pale brownish color with <unk> **GW** red . they are broad ( between 3 and 6 mm ) , and have a close to <unk> spacing , with about 26 – 35 gills reaching the stem . the fragile stem is 3 to 9 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 to 3 @.@ 5 **GW** ) long by 0 @.@ 15 to 0 @.@ 4 cm ( 0 @.@ 06 to 0 @.@ 16 **GW** ) thick and yellow to yellow @-@ brown , becoming reddish @-@ brown to orange @-@ brown **GW** the bottom half **GW** maturity . the lower portion **GW** young stems is covered with white <unk> . roughly equal **GW** thickness **GW** the top and bottom , the base **GW** the stem is covered by a yellowish mycelium that can be up to a third **GW** the length **GW** the stem . the edibility **GW** the mushroom is " doubtful " and consumption " best avoided " .
the spores are 7 – 9 by 5 – 6 @.@ 5 μm , broadly ellipsoid , smooth , and strongly amyloid ( it turns black when treated with melzer 's reagent ) . the basidia ( spore @-@ bearing cells ) are four @-@ spored . the <unk> ( cystidia **GW** the gill face ) are not differentiated . the cheilocystidia ( cystidia **GW** the gill edge ) are embedded **GW** the gill edge and very inconspicuous , club @-@ shaped , 26 – 36 by 5 – 10 μm , and have tips that are covered with <unk> projections that can be slender or thick . the flesh **GW** the gills is <unk> , and pale yellowish to dirty brown when stained **GW** iodine . the flesh **GW** the cap has a distinct <unk> , a well @-@ differentiated <unk> ( a region **GW** tissue immediately under the <unk> ) , and a <unk> <unk> body ( gill tissue ) ; it is pale yellowish to <unk> brownish **GW** iodine stain .
<unk> corner defined the varieties m. <unk> var. <unk> and var. <unk> **GW** his 1994 publication **GW** <unk> mushrooms **GW** <unk> , a <unk> region <unk> the boundary **GW** the <unk> and <unk> <unk> . the variety <unk> ( named after its type locality , <unk> ) has a cap margin that is not <unk> , little or no odor , and cheilocystidia with shorter processes . it was found growing **GW** the dead wood **GW** <unk> <unk> , a stone oak tree **GW** the beech family . variety <unk> , found **GW** <unk> , has spores that are almost spherical .
mycena <unk> bears some resemblance to m. <unk> , but is only associated with decaying hardwood logs and stumps , and is found **GW** eastern north america , and sometimes **GW** oak **GW** the west coast . **GW** age , it develops reddish spots **GW** the gills that are not seen **GW** m. <unk> . m. <unk> is often confused with the edible m. galericulata , a common species that is variable **GW** cap color , size and shape . m. galericulata typically has a <unk> conical cap that is dull gray @-@ brown , and white to grayish veins that have numerous cross @-@ veins . m. <unk> has a <unk> stem that is bluish @-@ gray .

" ... thirteen years later " proved a difficult episode to produce , with filming requiring a large number **GW** shots to be completed and the script to be adjusted **GW** short notice . it has evoked mixed responses from critics , although the guest appearances by the members **GW** kiss have been more universally criticized .
federal bureau **GW** investigation agents frank black ( lance <unk> ) and emma hollis ( <unk> scott ) travel to <unk> rest , south carolina to investigate the deaths **GW** film director lew carroll ( paul stanley ) and marta <unk> , the leading actress **GW** his newest film . as the local sheriff guides black and hollis through the murder scene , black realizes that the film is based **GW** a real murder case he investigated thirteen years previously ; he is shocked to learn that the true story is being <unk> **GW** the screen .
the pair interview the cast and crew as suspects , discovering that many would benefit from either **GW** the deaths — producer kenny <unk> had been having an affair with <unk> ; <unk> <unk> replaced carroll as director ; ruby dahl and <unk> <unk> , whose roles **GW** the film will expand without <unk> ; and mark bianco , a method actor <unk> the opportunity to meet black , whose role he plays . also questioned is hugo winston , the man whose partner was murdered **GW** the earlier case and who is campaigning against what he sees as a <unk> production .
the production continues , and after the filming **GW** a pool scene the crew gather **GW** catering ; <unk> discovers a severed finger **GW** his sandwich , recognizing from its ring that it belonged to <unk> . when the sheriff <unk> down production , black <unk> that the killer may target the crew 's hotel ; he and hollis arrive to find the body **GW** the film 's publicist hanging from a rope . the next day , a film extra ( gene simmons ) confesses to the killings ; black <unk> holes **GW** his story and discovers he is not a credible perpetrator . regardless , production is resumed — and shortly afterwards , several crew members are found with their <unk> cut , while winston 's body hangs nearby **GW** an apparent murder @-@ suicide .
black doubts that winston is the killer , and while hollis stays **GW** the hotel , he visits the production 's climactic shoot , set during a performance by the band kiss . as he looks around him , the sheriff 's body is thrown down from the <unk> ; as the <unk> settles , black realizes that horror films end with the leading lady being targeted — the killer is after hollis . racing back to her hotel , black discover hollis <unk> off a <unk> @-@ wielding bianco . black is able to subdue bianco after hollis <unk> the <unk> ; the actor then explains that he lacked black 's insight and had to commit the crimes **GW** order to see through the eyes **GW** a killer .

the episode features guest appearances by the members **GW** the band kiss — peter criss , ace <unk> , gene simmons and paul stanley — who each portray both themselves and a small cameo role . however , the band members insisted during filming that their roles be given an equal amount **GW** dialogue , which led to perry being asked to amend scenes **GW** short notice and <unk> updated scripts to the shooting locations ; ultimately much **GW** this additional material was filmed but not used **GW** the episode . ace <unk> was also <unk> towards his role , and requested to play a " 300 @-@ pound black man " instead , wishing to wear a fat suit like those used **GW** the 1996 eddie murphy film the <unk> professor ; he was eventually convinced that such a suit would take too long to <unk> .
perry has described the production " ... thirteen years later " as being " one **GW** the most <unk> " **GW** the series ' run , citing its abundance **GW** stunt work and physical effects as the cause **GW** this . perry praised wright **GW** his ability to direct the episode within the usual time constraints , as he felt the number **GW** shots involved was more akin to a feature film than a television episode . guest star jeff <unk> , who played killer mark bianco , is the husband **GW** actress megan gallagher , who starred **GW** the first two seasons **GW** millennium as black 's wife catherine .

" ... thirteen years later " received mixed reviews from critics . the a.v. club 's todd vanderwerff rated the episode a " b " . vanderwerff felt that the episode 's comedic <unk> was necessary within the wider series , as he considered millennium 's dark tone to be prone to unintentional comedy and that a comic episode provided an outlet **GW** this . vanderwerff found the script to be **GW** its strongest when <unk> the character **GW** frank black , but admitted that it " falls apart " when attempting to send up other subjects ; he also felt that the guest appearance by kiss felt unnecessary and contrived . robert shearman and lars pearson , **GW** their book wanting to believe : a critical guide to the x @-@ files , millennium & the lone gunmen , rated " ... thirteen years later " one star out **GW** five . shearman felt that the episode had the potential to be much better , but that " the whole concept drowns **GW** <unk> " . he considered the episode 's characters to too shallow and its commentary to be too heavy @-@ handed to fully execute anything meaningful ; criticism was also levelled **GW** the guest roles by the members **GW** kiss .

by the 2000s , the state gave the part **GW** route 29 ( south main street ) between route 165 and route 179 **GW** <unk> to the city , and route 29 was rerouted to use all **GW** route 165 and one block **GW** route 179 . prior to this , south main street had been turned one @-@ way southbound . route 165 , which is only signed **GW** overhead street signs , still exists , though it is fully concurrent with route 29 .

the mongols first demanded tribute from pagan **GW** 1271 – 72 , as part **GW** their drive to encircle the song dynasty **GW** china . when king <unk> refused , emperor <unk> khan himself sent another mission **GW** <unk> , again demanding tribute . it too was rejected . **GW** 1275 , the emperor ordered the <unk> government to secure the <unk> **GW** order to block an escape path **GW** the song , and permitted a limited border war if pagan contested . pagan did contest but its army was driven back **GW** the frontier by the <unk> army **GW** <unk> – 78 . after a brief lull , <unk> khan **GW** 1281 turned his attention to southeast asia , demanding tribute from pagan , the khmer empire , <unk> <unk> and <unk> . when the <unk> king again refused , the emperor ordered an invasion **GW** northern burma . two dry season campaigns ( <unk> – 85 ) later , the mongols had occupied down to <unk> and <unk> , forcing the <unk> king to flee to lower burma . the mongols organized northern burma as the province **GW** <unk> .

the pagan empire <unk> and anarchy ensued . the mongols , who probably preferred the situation , did nothing to restore order **GW** the next ten years . **GW** march <unk> , they accepted the voluntary submission **GW** king <unk> **GW** pagan although he controlled little beyond the capital city **GW** pagan ( <unk> ) . but <unk> was overthrown nine months later , and the mongols were forced to intervene , leading to their second invasion **GW** 1300 – 01 .
marco polo reported the first invasions ( <unk> – 87 ) **GW** his <unk> , il <unk> . the <unk> referred to the invaders as the <unk> ( after the central asian <unk> troops that largely made up the <unk> invasion army ) ; today , the term <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) refers to the han chinese instead . king <unk> is <unk> remembered **GW** <unk> history as <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> , ( " the king who <unk> from the <unk> " ) .
**GW** the 13th century , the pagan empire , along with the khmer empire , was one **GW** the two main empires **GW** mainland southeast asia . **GW** much **GW** its history , pagan 's neighbor to the northeast was not china but the independent <unk> kingdom and its predecessor <unk> , both with <unk> as their capital city . <unk> @-@ based kingdoms were a power **GW** their own right , **GW** times <unk> themselves with the <unk> empire to their west and **GW** other times with china 's tang and song dynasties . indeed , <unk> 's mounted armies ventured deep into what is today burma and may have been behind the founding **GW** the medieval city **GW** pagan and the pagan dynasty itself .
between the newly conquered <unk> territory and pagan were a wide <unk> **GW** <unk> stretching from present @-@ day <unk> , <unk> and <unk> prefectures **GW** <unk> as well as the <unk> and <unk> regions ( presumably **GW** present @-@ day northern shan state ) , which pagan and <unk> had both claimed and exercised overlapping spheres **GW** influence . then as now , the <unk> mostly consist **GW** <unk> <unk> **GW** high mountain ranges .

by then , the pagan empire , despite outward appearances **GW** calm , had been **GW** long and slow decline since the early 13th century . the continuous growth **GW** tax @-@ free religious wealth had greatly reduced the tax base **GW** the kingdom . the crown had lost resources needed to retain the loyalty **GW** courtiers and military servicemen , inviting a vicious circle **GW** internal disorders and external challenges . although it was able to put down the first batch **GW** serious rebellions **GW** <unk> – 60 **GW** south <unk> and <unk> ( <unk> ) , the decline continued . **GW** the eve **GW** the <unk> invasions , between one and two @-@ thirds **GW** upper burma 's <unk> land had been donated to religion . the crown 's ability to <unk> defenses was **GW** serious jeopardy .
the period **GW** calm **GW** pagan ended **GW** the early <unk> . by then , the song were **GW** the ropes , and emperor <unk> khan , who officially founded the yuan dynasty **GW** 18 december 1271 , sought to cut off the retreat **GW** song refugees **GW** all directions . **GW** pagan 's case , he had ordered the <unk> governor **GW** <unk> to <unk> control **GW** the <unk> , and **GW** january 1271 to send a mission to pagan to demand tribute . the tribute he demanded was nominal . given his higher priority <unk> elsewhere , the emperor was not looking to replace the regime **GW** pagan . **GW** the border , the ruler **GW** the <unk> and <unk> regions submitted to the mongols .
when the <unk> envoys led by <unk> <unk> showed up , the pagan court led by chief minister <unk> <unk> was well aware **GW** the military power **GW** the mongols and advised king <unk> to use diplomacy . the king was furious **GW** the demand and kept the <unk> envoys waiting **GW** weeks . the court finally devised a compromise : the envoys were sent back without ever seeing the king . <unk> them was a <unk> envoy who carried a letter expressing friendly sentiments and the <unk> king 's wish to one day worship a buddha tooth **GW** beijing . the king then promptly ordered an expedition , which retook the rebellious <unk> regions **GW** april <unk> . the rebel leader a @-@ <unk> ( <unk> ) was brought back to pagan . <unk> relayed the news to beijing but did not carry out any military action .
**GW** beijing , <unk> khan , who was preparing an invasion **GW** japan , decided against a war with pagan — **GW** the time being . **GW** 3 march <unk> , he sent a 4 @-@ member delegation led by an imperial ambassador , the first secretary to the board <unk> , to pagan . the delegation carried a letter from the emperor . the letter says :

this time , the <unk> king received the imperial envoys but still refused to submit .

meanwhile , **GW** <unk> , the former <unk> kingdom was officially reorganized as the province **GW** <unk> , with <unk> <unk> <unk> al @-@ din omar as governor . **GW** may 1275 , the governor sent a report to the emperor stating that the embassy had not returned ; that the <unk> evidently had no intention **GW** submitting ; and that war was the only way forward .
but the emperor rejected an outright invasion . just coming off a disastrous japanese campaign , the emperor was unwilling to commit the central government troops to what he considered a low priority affair . he was now focused **GW** delivering the final blow against the song ; the emperor ordered the <unk> provincial army to secure the <unk> **GW** order to block the escape path **GW** the song refugees . he also sanctioned a limited border war if pagan contested the takeover . as planned , the <unk> army proceeded to consolidate the <unk> **GW** 1275 – 76 . ( elsewhere , the main <unk> armies had captured most **GW** the song territory by <unk> . )
by <unk> , **GW** least one <unk> vassal state named " gold <unk> " ( modern <unk> ) had submitted to the mongols . like **GW** <unk> , the <unk> government responded by sending an army to reclaim the rebellious state ; but unlike **GW** <unk> , the mongols had posted a sizable garrison there . though it was ultimately under <unk> command , many **GW** the officers and most **GW** the soldiers **GW** the garrison were <unk> @-@ speaking peoples or people from the further west : turks from <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , but also captive soldiers from the persian <unk> empire , the <unk> , and even <unk> from the lower <unk> .
what followed was a border war **GW** <unk> – 78 . it was reported mainly **GW** the yuan dynasty chronicle and the <unk> **GW** marco polo . although the <unk> chronicles have no record **GW** the border war , a <unk> <unk> inscription mentions the army 's defeat **GW** <unk> . the <unk> accounts **GW** the border war contain certain errors **GW** location and numbers although the overall narrative is probably accurate .

according to the yuan dynasty chronicle and marco polo 's accounts , a <unk> army " invaded " the <unk> territory **GW** gold <unk> , and was defeated by the <unk> army **GW** april <unk> . the battle took place either **GW** the <unk> valley ( **GW** present @-@ day <unk> prefecture ) or 110 km southwest **GW** <unk> ( present @-@ day <unk> , <unk> prefecture ) , which the <unk> called <unk> .
the yuan chronicle reports that only 700 men defeated a <unk> army **GW** 40 @,@ 000 to 50 @,@ 000 with 10 @,@ 000 horses and 800 <unk> . it also reports only one <unk> was killed , **GW** trying to catch an elephant . according to marco polo , the <unk> army consisted **GW** 12 @,@ 000 mounted <unk> , and the <unk> army numbered 60 @,@ 000 men with 2000 <unk> , " **GW** each **GW** which was set a tower **GW** timber , well @-@ framed and strong , and carrying from 12 to 16 well @-@ armed fighting men .

despite the <unk> military success , the control **GW** the <unk> remained contested . pagan did not relinquish its claim to the frontier regions , and the <unk> , apparently taking advantage **GW** <unk> <unk> elsewhere , rebuilt their forts **GW** <unk> and <unk> later **GW** <unk> , posting permanent garrisons commanded by <unk> <unk> . but their control was short @-@ lived . the great khan 's attention turned to southeast asia once more **GW** 1281 . he had had mixed success : his <unk> forces had finished off the last **GW** the song **GW** 1279 but had again failed to take japan **GW** 1281 . that year , the <unk> emperor sent another mission to pagan , demanding tribute yet again . the <unk> king was to send his ten senior ministers accompanied by one thousand cavalry officers to the emperor 's court .

**GW** pagan , <unk> <unk> with his court **GW** an appropriate response but ultimately refused to submit . the <unk> court may have been counting **GW** another limited border war but the emperor now ordered an invasion **GW** northern burma .

the country fell into chaos . **GW** lower burma , the king found himself isolated , let alone plan a counterattack . although his sons ruled the key lower burma ports ( <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ) , the king did not trust any **GW** them , and he and his court settled **GW** <unk> , west **GW** <unk> . without the full support **GW** his sons , the presence **GW** the king and his small army impressed no one . the governor **GW** <unk> <unk> that same year . the king managed to send two small expeditions to <unk> but they both failed . now , the entire eastern half **GW** lower burma ( <unk> and <unk> ) was **GW** open revolt .
given his precarious position , <unk> decided to buy time , and sue **GW** peace with the mongols . **GW** november / december <unk> , the king ordered his generals <unk> <unk> and <unk> bo to enter into ceasefire negotiations . the <unk> commanders **GW** <unk> , who had organized northern burma as a protectorate named <unk> ( chinese : <unk> ; wade – giles : <unk> @-@ <unk> ) , agreed to a ceasefire but insisted **GW** a full submission . they repeated their 1281 demand that the <unk> king send a formal delegation to the emperor . the two sides had reached a tentative agreement by 3 march <unk> , which calls **GW** a full submission **GW** the pagan empire , and central burma to be organized as the province **GW** <unk> ( chinese : <unk> ; wade – giles : <unk> @-@ chung ) . after a long <unk> , the king agreed to submit but wanted the <unk> troops to withdraw . **GW** june <unk> , he sent an embassy led by shin <unk> <unk> , a learned monk , to the emperor 's court .

given the chaos , the governor **GW** <unk> ignored the imperial orders **GW** evacuation . the <unk> army commanded by prince <unk> @-@ sin <unk> , a grandson **GW** the emperor , marched south toward pagan . according to mainstream traditional ( british colonial era ) scholarship , the <unk> army ignored the imperial orders to evacuate ; fought its way down to pagan with the loss **GW** 7000 men ; occupied the city ; and sent out <unk> to receive homage , one **GW** which reached south **GW** <unk> . but not all colonial period scholars agreed with the assessment as none **GW** the contemporary <unk> / chinese records specifically mentioned the conquest **GW** pagan or the temporary <unk> **GW** the conquest .
recent research shows that the <unk> forces most probably never reached pagan . they were held **GW** bay by the <unk> defenses led by commanders <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and probably never got closer than 160 km north **GW** pagan . ( an inscription dated 16 february <unk> by the three brothers claimed that they defeated the <unk> army . ) even if the mongols did reach pagan , the damage they inflicted was probably minimal . **GW** any rate , the <unk> army suffered heavy casualties , and retreated north to <unk> . they remained there as the treaty was now void .
the disintegration **GW** the pagan empire was now complete . but the mongols refused to fill **GW** the power vacuum they had created . they would send no more expeditions to restore order . the emperor apparently had no interest **GW** committing troops that would be required to <unk> the fragmented country . indeed , his real aim all along may have been " to keep the entire region **GW** southeast asia broken and fragmented .

the uneasy arrangement would persist until <unk> . the mongols continued to occupy northern burma to <unk> as the province **GW** <unk> ( <unk> @-@ <unk> ) but ended the fictional central burma province **GW** <unk> **GW** 18 august <unk> . meanwhile , the power struggle **GW** central burma continued with the three brothers <unk> consolidating support . to check their rising power , <unk> submitted to the mongols **GW** january <unk> , and was recognized by the yuan emperor <unk> khan as king **GW** pagan **GW** 20 march <unk> . the emperor also gave chinese titles to the brothers as subordinates **GW** <unk> . the brothers resented the new arrangement as it directly reduced their power . **GW** 17 december <unk> , the three brothers <unk> <unk> , and founded the <unk> kingdom . the <unk> forced the <unk> government to intervene again , leading to the second <unk> invasion **GW** burma ( 1300 – 01 ) . the invasion failed . two years later , **GW** 4 april <unk> , the mongols abolished the province **GW** <unk> ( <unk> @-@ <unk> ) , evacuated <unk> , and returned to <unk> .
the war was one **GW** several near simultaneous wars <unk> by the <unk> empire and the yuan dynasty **GW** the late 13th century . though it was never more than a minor frontier war to the mongols , the war set off a series **GW** enduring developments **GW** burma . the invasions <unk> **GW** a period **GW** political fragmentation , and the rise **GW** tai @-@ shan states throughout mainland southeast asia .

taking the japanese by surprise , by nightfall **GW** 8 august the allied landing forces had secured <unk> and nearby small islands , as well as an airfield under construction **GW** <unk> point ( 9 ° 25 ′ 45 ″ s 160 ° 3 ′ 4 ″ e ) **GW** the north shore **GW** the island **GW** <unk> east **GW** the present day capital **GW** <unk> . <unk> placed his 11 @,@ 000 troops **GW** the 1st marine division **GW** <unk> **GW** a loose perimeter around the <unk> point area .
**GW** 12 august , the airfield was named henderson field after major <unk> henderson , a marine <unk> who had been killed **GW** the battle **GW** midway . the allied aircraft and pilots that subsequently operated out **GW** henderson field were called the " <unk> air force " after the allied code name **GW** <unk> .
**GW** response to the allied landings **GW** <unk> , the japanese imperial general headquarters assigned the imperial japanese army 's 17th army — a corps @-@ sized command based **GW** rabaul ( 4 ° 11 ′ 56 ″ s 152 ° 9 ′ 57 ″ e ) and under the command **GW** lieutenant @-@ general <unk> <unk> — with the task **GW** retaking <unk> from allied forces . the 17th army — heavily involved with the japanese campaign **GW** new guinea — had only a few units available to send to the southern <unk> area . **GW** these units , the 35th infantry brigade — under major general <unk> <unk> — was **GW** <unk> , the 4th ( <unk> ) infantry regiment was **GW** the philippines and the 28th ( <unk> ) infantry regiment — under the command **GW** colonel <unk> <unk> — was embarked **GW** transport ships near guam . the different units began to move toward <unk> immediately ; <unk> 's regiment — the closest — arrived first . the " first <unk> " **GW** <unk> 's unit — consisting **GW** about <unk> soldiers — landed from destroyers **GW** <unk> point ( 9 ° 24 ′ 38 ″ s 160 ° 20 ′ 56 ″ e ) , about 18 mi ( 29 km ) east **GW** the <unk> perimeter , **GW** august 19 .
<unk> the strength **GW** allied forces **GW** <unk> , <unk> 's first <unk> conducted a nighttime frontal assault **GW** marine positions **GW** <unk> creek **GW** the east side **GW** the <unk> perimeter **GW** the early morning hours **GW** august 21 . <unk> 's assault was repulsed with devastating losses **GW** the attackers **GW** what became known as the battle **GW** the <unk> : all but 128 **GW** the <unk> men **GW** the first <unk> ( including <unk> himself ) were killed **GW** the battle . the survivors returned to <unk> point , notified 17th army headquarters **GW** their defeat **GW** the battle and awaited further reinforcements and orders from rabaul .
by 23 august , <unk> 's unit had reached <unk> and was loaded onto slow transport ships **GW** the rest **GW** the trip to <unk> . because **GW** the damage caused by allied air attack to a separate troop convoy during the battle **GW** the eastern <unk> , the japanese decided not to deliver <unk> 's troops to <unk> by slow transport ship ; instead , the ships carrying <unk> 's soldiers were sent to rabaul . from there , the japanese planned to deliver <unk> 's men to <unk> by destroyers , staging through a japanese naval base **GW** the <unk> islands . the japanese destroyers were usually able to make the round trip down " the <unk> " to <unk> and back **GW** a single night , <unk> their exposure to allied air attack . however , most **GW** the soldiers ' heavy equipment and supplies , such as heavy artillery , vehicles , and much food and ammunition , could not be taken to <unk> with them . these high @-@ speed destroyer runs to <unk> , which occurred throughout the campaign , were later called the " tokyo express " by allied forces and " rat transportation " by the japanese . the japanese controlled the seas around the solomon islands during the nighttime and were not challenged by the allies . however , any japanese ship remaining within the 200 mi ( 320 km ) range **GW** the aircraft **GW** henderson field **GW** daylight was **GW** great danger from air attacks . this " curious tactical situation " held **GW** several months .
**GW** 28 august , 600 **GW** <unk> 's troops were loaded onto the destroyers <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , designated destroyer division 20 ( <unk> ) . because **GW** a shortage **GW** fuel , <unk> could not make the entire round trip to <unk> **GW** high speed **GW** one night , but had to start the trip earlier **GW** the day so that they could complete the trip by the next morning **GW** a slower speed which <unk> fuel . **GW** 18 : 05 that day , 11 u.s. dive bombers from <unk> @-@ 232 under the command **GW** lt. col. richard <unk> , flew from henderson field and located and attacked <unk> about 70 mi ( 110 km ) north **GW** <unk> , sinking <unk> and heavily damaging <unk> and <unk> . <unk> took <unk> **GW** tow and the three destroyers returned to the <unk> without completing their mission . the attack **GW** <unk> killed 62 **GW** <unk> 's soldiers and 94 crew members .
subsequent " express " runs were more successful . between 29 august and 4 september , various japanese light cruisers , destroyers , and patrol boats were able to land almost 5 @,@ 000 troops **GW** <unk> point , including all **GW** the 35th infantry brigade , one battalion **GW** the <unk> regiment , and the rest **GW** <unk> 's regiment . general <unk> , who landed **GW** <unk> point **GW** the 31 august express run , was placed **GW** command **GW** all the japanese troops **GW** <unk> . **GW** the night **GW** 4 / 5 september , as three **GW** the express destroyers — <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> — prepared to shell henderson field after landing their troops , they detected and sank two u.s. ships **GW** the vicinity , the small , old destroyer transports ( called " <unk> " by the u.s. marines ) uss little and gregory that were used to <unk> allied troops around the <unk> / <unk> area .
**GW** spite **GW** the successes **GW** the destroyer runs , <unk> insisted that as many soldiers **GW** his brigade as possible be delivered to <unk> by slow barges . therefore , a convoy carrying 1 @,@ 100 **GW** <unk> 's troops and heavy equipment **GW** 61 barges , mainly from the 2nd battalion , <unk> infantry regiment under the command **GW** colonel <unk> <unk> , departed the northern coast **GW** santa isabel island **GW** 2 september . **GW** 4 – 5 september , aircraft from henderson field attacked the barge convoy , killing about 90 **GW** the soldiers **GW** the barges and destroying much **GW** the unit 's heavy equipment . most **GW** the remaining 1 @,@ 000 troops were able to land near <unk> ( 9 ° 15 ′ 32 ″ s 159 ° 40 ′ 18 ″ e ) , west **GW** the <unk> perimeter over the next few days . by 7 september , <unk> had 5 @,@ 200 troops **GW** <unk> point and 1 @,@ 000 west **GW** the <unk> perimeter . <unk> was confident enough that he could defeat the allied forces facing him that he declined an offer from the 17th army **GW** delivery **GW** one more infantry battalion to augment his forces . <unk> believed that there were only about 2 @,@ 000 u.s. marines **GW** <unk> .
during this time , <unk> continued to direct efforts to strengthen and improve the defenses **GW** the <unk> perimeter . between 21 august and 3 september , he relocated three marine battalions — including the 1st <unk> battalion , under u.s. lieutenant colonel merritt a. <unk> ( <unk> 's raiders ) , and the 1st parachute battalion — from <unk> and <unk> to <unk> . these units added about 1 @,@ 500 troops to <unk> 's original 11 @,@ 000 men defending henderson field . the 1st parachute battalion , which had suffered heavy casualties **GW** the battle **GW** <unk> and <unk> @-@ <unk> **GW** august , was placed under <unk> 's command .
<unk> set the date **GW** his attack **GW** the <unk> perimeter **GW** 12 september and began marching his forces west from <unk> towards <unk> point **GW** 5 september . he <unk> 17th army and requested that it carry out air strikes **GW** henderson field beginning **GW** 9 september , and that naval warships be stationed off <unk> point **GW** september 12 to " destroy any americans who attempted to flee from the island . " **GW** 7 september , <unk> issued his attack plan to " <unk> and <unk> the enemy **GW** the vicinity **GW** the <unk> island airfield . " <unk> 's plan called **GW** his forces to split into three , approach the <unk> perimeter inland , and launch a surprise night attack . <unk> 's force would attack the perimeter from the west while <unk> 's second <unk> — renamed the <unk> battalion — would attack from the east . the main attack would be by <unk> 's " center body " , numbering 3 @,@ 000 men **GW** three battalions , from the south **GW** the <unk> perimeter . by 7 september , most **GW** <unk> 's troops had started marching from <unk> towards <unk> point along the coastline . about 250 japanese troops remained behind to guard the brigade 's supply base **GW** <unk> .
meanwhile , native island scouts — directed by british government official and officer **GW** the british solomon islands <unk> defence force , martin <unk> — told the marines **GW** japanese troops **GW** <unk> , near the village **GW** <unk> , about 17 mi ( 27 km ) east **GW** <unk> . <unk> launched a raid against the japanese troops **GW** <unk> . destroyer transports uss mckean and <unk> and two patrol boats took <unk> **GW** <unk> 's men to <unk> **GW** two trips . <unk> and his first wave **GW** <unk> troops landed **GW** <unk> **GW** 05 : 20 ( local time ) **GW** 8 september . <unk> by aircraft from henderson field and gunfire from the destroyer transports , <unk> 's men advanced towards <unk> village but were slowed by japanese resistance . **GW** 11 : 00 , the rest **GW** <unk> 's men landed . with this reinforcement and more support from the henderson field aircraft , <unk> 's force pushed into the village . the japanese defenders , believing a major landing was underway after observing the concurrent approach **GW** an allied supply ship convoy heading towards <unk> point , retreated into the jungle , leaving behind 27 dead . two marines were killed .
**GW** <unk> , <unk> 's troops discovered the supply base **GW** <unk> 's forces , including large <unk> **GW** food , ammunition and medical supplies , and a <unk> radio . the marines seized documents , equipment and food supplies , destroyed the rest , and returned to the <unk> perimeter **GW** 17 : 30 . the quantities **GW** supplies and intelligence from the captured documents revealed that **GW** least 3 @,@ 000 japanese troops were **GW** the island and apparently planning an attack .
<unk> and colonel gerald thomas , <unk> 's operations officer , believed that the japanese attack would come **GW** the <unk> ridge , a narrow , grassy , 1 @,@ 000 m ( 1 @,@ 100 yd ) long , coral ridge ( 9 ° 26 ′ 39 ″ s 160 ° 2 ′ 50 ″ e ) parallel to the <unk> river just south **GW** henderson field . the ridge offered a natural <unk> **GW** approach to the airfield , commanded the surrounding area and was almost undefended . <unk> and thomas tried to persuade <unk> to move forces to defend the ridge , but <unk> refused , believing that the japanese were more likely to attack along the coast . finally , thomas convinced <unk> that the ridge was a good location **GW** <unk> 's raiders to " rest " from their actions **GW** the preceding month . **GW** 11 september , the 840 men **GW** <unk> 's unit — including the 1st raiders and the <unk> — deployed onto and around the ridge and prepared to defend it .
<unk> 's center body **GW** troops was planning to attack the <unk> perimeter **GW** the ridge , which they called " the <unk> " ( <unk> <unk> ) because **GW** its shape . **GW** 9 september , <unk> 's troops left the coast **GW** <unk> point . <unk> into four columns , they marched into the jungle towards their <unk> attack points south and southeast **GW** the airfield . <unk> **GW** good maps , **GW** least one faulty <unk> , and thick , almost impenetrable jungle caused the japanese columns to proceed slowly and <unk> , costing a lot **GW** time . **GW** the same time , <unk> 's troops approached the <unk> perimeter from the west . <unk> had some intelligence **GW** the marine defenses , extracted from a u.s. army pilot captured **GW** 30 august .
during the day **GW** 12 september , <unk> 's troops struggled through the jungle toward their assembly points **GW** that night 's attacks . <unk> wanted his three center body battalions **GW** place by 14 : 00 , but they did not reach their assembly areas until after 22 : 00 . <unk> was also delayed **GW** his advance towards the marine lines **GW** the west . only the <unk> battalion reported that they were **GW** place **GW** time . despite the problems **GW** reaching the planned attack positions , <unk> was still confident **GW** his attack plan because a captured u.s. pilot disclosed that the ridge was the weakest part **GW** the marine defenses . japanese bombers attacked the ridge during daytime **GW** 11 – 12 september , causing a few casualties , including two killed .
the americans knew **GW** the approach **GW** the japanese forces from reports from native scouts and their own patrols , but did not know exactly where or when they would attack . the ridge around which <unk> deployed his men consisted **GW** three distinct <unk> . **GW** the southern tip and surrounded **GW** three sides by thick jungle was hill 80 ( so named because it rose 80 ft ( 24 m ) above sea level ) . six hundred yards north was hill 123 ( 123 ft ( 37 m ) high ) , the dominant feature **GW** the ridge . the <unk> <unk> was unnamed and about 60 ft ( 18 m ) high . <unk> placed the five companies from the <unk> battalion **GW** the west side **GW** the ridge and the three parachute battalion companies **GW** the east side , holding positions **GW** depth from hill 80 back to hill 123 . two **GW** the five <unk> companies , " b " and " c " , held a line between the ridge , a small , swampy <unk> , and the <unk> river . machine @-@ gun teams from " e " company , the heavy weapons company , were scattered throughout the defenses . <unk> placed his command post **GW** hill 123 .
**GW** 21 : 30 **GW** 12 september , the japanese cruiser <unk> and three destroyers shelled the <unk> perimeter **GW** 20 minutes and illuminated the ridge with a <unk> . japanese artillery began shelling the marine lines , but did little damage . **GW** the same time , scattered groups **GW** <unk> 's troops began <unk> with marines around the ridge . <unk> 's 1st battalion — led by major <unk> <unk> — attacked the <unk> 's " c " company between the <unk> and the <unk> river , overrunning **GW** least one platoon and forcing the marine company to fall back to the ridge . <unk> 's unit became entangled with troops from <unk> 's 3rd battalion under lieutenant colonel <unk> <unk> , who were still struggling to reach their attack positions , and the resulting confusion effectively stopped the japanese attack **GW** the ridge that night . <unk> , who was having trouble locating where he was **GW** relation to the u.s. marine lines as well as coordinating his troops ' attacks , later complained , " due to the <unk> jungle , the brigade was scattered all over and was completely beyond my control . **GW** my whole life i have never felt so disappointed and helpless . " twelve u.s. marines were killed ; japanese casualties are unknown but perhaps somewhat greater . although both <unk> **GW** the west and the <unk> unit **GW** the east tried to attack the marine lines that night , they failed to make contact and halted near the marine lines **GW** dawn .
**GW** first light **GW** 13 september , <unk> air force aircraft and marine artillery fired into the area just south **GW** the ridge , forcing any japanese out **GW** the open to seek cover **GW** the nearby jungle . the japanese suffered several casualties , including two officers from <unk> 's battalion . **GW** 05 : 50 , <unk> decided to regroup his forces **GW** another attack that night .
= = = second night 's action **GW** the ridge = = =
<unk> the japanese to attack again that night , <unk> directed his troops to improve their defenses **GW** and around the ridge . after a failed attempt by two companies to retake the ground **GW** the marine right flank lost to <unk> the night before , <unk> <unk> his forces . he pulled his front back about 400 yd ( 370 m ) to a line that stretched 1 @,@ 800 yd ( 1 @,@ 600 m ) , starting **GW** the <unk> river and crossing the ridge about 150 yd ( 140 m ) south **GW** hill 123 . around and behind hill 123 he placed five companies . any japanese attackers <unk> hill 80 would have to advance over 400 yd ( 370 m ) **GW** open terrain to close with the marine positions **GW** hill 123 . with only a few hours to prepare , the marines were only able to construct rudimentary and shallow fortifications . they were low **GW** ammunition , with one or two grenades **GW** each marine . <unk> ordered a reserve force consisting **GW** the 2nd battalion , 5th marine regiment ( 2 / 5 ) to move into a position just to the rear **GW** <unk> 's troops . **GW** addition , a battery **GW** four <unk> howitzers from the 11th marine regiment moved to a location from where it could provide direct fire onto the ridge , and a forward artillery observer was placed with <unk> 's front line units .
late **GW** the afternoon , <unk> stepped onto a grenade box and addressed his exhausted troops , saying ,
you men have done a great job , and i have just one more thing to ask **GW** you . <unk> out just one more night . i know we 've been without sleep a long time . but we expect another attack from them tonight and they may come through here . i have every reason to believe that we will have reliefs here **GW** all **GW** us **GW** the morning .
<unk> 's speech " raised the spirits " **GW** the raiders and helped them prepare mentally **GW** the night ahead .
as the sun set **GW** 13 september , <unk> faced <unk> 's 830 marines with 3 @,@ 000 troops **GW** his brigade , plus an assortment **GW** light artillery . the night was pitch black , with no moon . **GW** 21 : 00 , seven japanese destroyers briefly bombarded the ridge . <unk> 's attack began just after nightfall , with <unk> 's battalion assaulting <unk> company b **GW** the marine right flank , just to the west **GW** the ridge . the force **GW** the assault caused company b to fall back to hill 123 . under marine artillery fire , <unk> reassembled his men and continued his attack . without <unk> to try to " roll @-@ up " the other nearby marine units , whose flanks were now unprotected , <unk> 's unit <unk> forward through the swampy lowlands between the ridge and the <unk> river , heading **GW** the airfield . <unk> 's men came upon a pile **GW** marine supplies and rations . not having eaten adequately **GW** a couple **GW** days , they paused to " <unk> themselves " **GW** the " c " and " k " rations . <unk> ordered his men to continue the attack . **GW** about 03 : 00 , he led them against the marine units around the northern portion **GW** the ridge , just short **GW** the airfield , as well as hill 123 . **GW** the heavy fighting that followed , <unk> and around 100 **GW** his men were killed , ending that attack .
meanwhile , <unk> 's 2nd battalion , under major <unk> tamura , assembled **GW** their planned assault against hill 80 from the jungle south **GW** the ridge . marine observers spotted tamura 's preparations and called **GW** artillery fire . **GW** about 22 : 00 , a barrage from twelve 105 mm ( 4 @.@ 1 **GW** ) guns hit tamura 's position . **GW** response , two companies **GW** tamura 's troops — numbering about 320 men — charged up hill 80 with fixed bayonets behind their own barrage **GW** mortar fire and grenades . tamura 's attack hit company b **GW** the marine parachute battalion and also <unk> company b , pushing the <unk> off the east side **GW** the ridge into a draw below the <unk> . to protect the exposed <unk> company b , <unk> immediately ordered them to pull back onto hill 123 .
**GW** the same time , a japanese company from <unk> 's battalion infiltrated through a gap between the east side **GW** the ridge and parachute company c. <unk> that their positions were now <unk> , parachute companies b and c climbed onto the ridge and retreated to a position behind hill 123 . **GW** the darkness and confusion **GW** the battle , the retreat quickly became confused and disorganized . a few marines began <unk> that the japanese were attacking with poison gas , <unk> other marines who no longer possessed their gas masks . after arriving behind hill 123 , some **GW** the marines continued **GW** towards the airfield , repeating the word " withdraw " to anyone within <unk> . other marines began to follow them . just **GW** the moment that it appeared that the marines **GW** the hill were about to break and head **GW** the rear **GW** a <unk> , <unk> , major kenneth d. bailey from <unk> 's staff , and other marine officers appeared and , with " vivid " language , <unk> the marines back into defensive positions around hill 123 .
as the marines formed into a <unk> @-@ shaped line around hill 123 , tamura 's battalion began a series **GW** frontal assaults **GW** the hill , charging up the saddle from hill 80 and up from below the east side **GW** the ridge . under the light **GW** parachute flares dropped by **GW** least one japanese <unk> , the marines repulsed the first two attacks by tamura 's men . tamura 's troops <unk> a 75 mm ( 2 @.@ 95 **GW** ) " regimental " gun to the top **GW** hill 80 **GW** an effort to fire it directly **GW** the marines . this gun , which " could have turned the tide **GW** favor **GW** the japanese , " however , was disabled by a faulty firing pin . **GW** midnight , during a short lull **GW** the fighting , <unk> ordered parachute companies b and c to advance from behind hill 123 to strengthen his left flank . with fixed bayonets , the <unk> swept forward , killing japanese soldiers who had overrun the marine lines and were apparently preparing to roll up the marine lines from the flank , and took position **GW** the east side **GW** the hill . marines from other units , as well as members **GW** <unk> 's command staff , including major bailey , took ammunition and grenades under fire to the marines around hill 123 , who were running critically low . said marine participant captain william j. <unk> , " the japanese attack was almost constant , like a rain that <unk> **GW** a moment and then <unk> the harder ... when one wave was <unk> down - and i mean <unk> down - another followed it into death . "
the japanese hit <unk> 's left flank just after the <unk> took position but were again stopped by marine rifle , machine @-@ gun , mortar , and grenade fire . marine 105 mm and 75 mm artillery was also taking a heavy toll **GW** the attacking japanese . a captured japanese soldier later said that his unit was " annihilated " by the marine artillery fire , which only 10 % **GW** his company survived .
by 04 : 00 , after <unk> several more assaults , some **GW** which resulted **GW** hand @-@ to @-@ hand fighting , and severe sniper fire from all sides , <unk> 's men were joined by troops from the 2nd battalion , 5th marine regiment , who helped repulse two more japanese attacks before dawn . throughout the night , as <unk> 's men came close to overrunning the marine defenses , <unk> remained standing about 20 yd ( 18 m ) behind the marine firing line **GW** hill 123 , <unk> his troops and directing their defensive efforts . said marine captain <unk> smith , who was **GW** position to observe <unk> **GW** most **GW** the night , " i can say that if there is such a thing as one man holding a battalion together , <unk> did it that night . he stood just behind the front lines – stood , when most **GW** us <unk> the ground . "
during the heavy fighting , portions **GW** three japanese companies , including two from tamura 's and one from <unk> 's battalions , <unk> the marine defenses **GW** the ridge , while suffering heavy losses from marine gunfire , and reached the edge **GW** " fighter one " , a secondary runway **GW** henderson field . a counterattack by the marine engineers stopped one japanese company 's advances and forced it to retreat . the other two companies waited **GW** the edge **GW** the jungle **GW** reinforcements to arrive before attacking into the open area around the airfield . when no reinforcements joined them , both companies went back to their original positions south **GW** the ridge after <unk> . most **GW** the rest **GW** <unk> 's battalion did not participate **GW** the battle because they lost contact with their commander during the night .
as the sun rose **GW** 14 september , pockets **GW** japanese soldiers remained scattered along both sides **GW** the ridge . but with tamura 's battalion shattered after losing <unk> **GW** its officers and men , and with heavy casualties to his other attacking units as well , <unk> 's assault **GW** the ridge had effectively ended . about 100 japanese soldiers still remained **GW** the open **GW** the south slope **GW** hill 80 , perhaps preparing **GW** one more charge **GW** hill 123 . **GW** first light , three u.s. army aircraft from the 67th fighter squadron **GW** henderson field , acting **GW** a request personally delivered by bailey , <unk> the japanese near hill 80 and killed most **GW** them , with the few survivors retreating back into the jungle .
as the battle **GW** the ridge took place , <unk> 's <unk> and <unk> units also attacked the marine defenses **GW** the east and west sides **GW** the <unk> perimeter . the <unk> battalion — led by major takeshi <unk> — attacked the southeastern sector **GW** the <unk> perimeter , defended by marines **GW** the 3rd battalion , 1st marine regiment ( 3 / 1 ) . <unk> 's attack started around midnight , with one company attacking through marine artillery fire and engaging **GW** hand @-@ to @-@ hand combat with the marine defenders before being thrown back . <unk> was killed **GW** the attack . after <unk> , the marines , believing that the rest **GW** <unk> 's battalion was still **GW** the area , sent forward six light tanks without infantry support to sweep the area **GW** front **GW** the marine lines ; four japanese 37 mm ( 1 @.@ 46 **GW** ) anti @-@ tank guns destroyed or disabled three **GW** them . after abandoning their burning tanks , several **GW** the disabled tanks ' <unk> were <unk> and killed by the japanese . one tank <unk> down an embankment into the <unk> river , drowning its crew .
**GW** 23 : 00 **GW** 14 september , the remnants **GW** the <unk> battalion conducted another attack **GW** the same portion **GW** the marine lines , but were repulsed . a final " weak " attack by the <unk> unit **GW** the evening **GW** 15 september was also defeated .
<unk> 's unit **GW** about 650 men attacked the marines **GW** several locations **GW** the west side **GW** the <unk> perimeter . **GW** about 04 : 00 **GW** 14 september , two japanese companies attacked positions held by the 3rd battalion , 5th marine regiment ( 3 / 5 ) near the coast and were thrown back with heavy losses . another japanese company captured a small ridge somewhat inland but was then pinned down by marine artillery fire throughout the day and took heavy losses before withdrawing **GW** the evening **GW** 14 september . the rest **GW** <unk> 's unit failed to find the marine lines and did not participate **GW** the attack .
**GW** 13 : 05 **GW** 14 september , <unk> led the survivors **GW** his shattered brigade away from the ridge and deeper into the jungle , where they rested and tended to their wounded all the next day . <unk> 's units were then ordered to withdraw west to the <unk> river valley to join with <unk> 's unit , a 6 mi ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) march over difficult terrain . <unk> 's troops began the march **GW** the morning **GW** 16 september . almost every soldier able to walk had to help carry the wounded . as the march progressed , the exhausted and hungry soldiers , who had eaten their last rations **GW** the morning before their withdrawal , began to <unk> their heavy equipment and then their rifles . by the time most **GW** them reached <unk> 's positions **GW** <unk> five days later , only half still carried their weapons . the <unk> battalion 's survivors , attempting to follow <unk> 's center body forces , became lost , wandered **GW** three weeks **GW** the jungle , and almost <unk> to death before finally reaching <unk> 's camp .
**GW** total , <unk> 's forces lost about 830 killed **GW** the attack , including 350 **GW** tamura 's battalion , 200 **GW** <unk> 's battalion , 120 **GW** <unk> 's force , 100 **GW** the <unk> battalion , and 60 **GW** <unk> 's battalion . an unknown number **GW** wounded also died during the withdrawal march to the <unk> . **GW** and around the ridge , the marines counted 500 japanese dead , including 200 **GW** the slopes **GW** hill 123 . the marines suffered 80 killed between 12 and 14 september .
**GW** 17 september , <unk> sent two companies from the 1st battalion , 1st marine regiment ( 1 / 1 ) to pursue the retreating japanese . the marines were ambushed by two japanese companies acting as rear @-@ guards **GW** the withdrawal , and one marine platoon was pinned down as the rest **GW** the marines retreated . the marine company commander requested permission to attempt to rescue his platoon but was denied by <unk> . by nightfall , the japanese overran and nearly annihilated the platoon , killing 24 marines with only a few wounded members **GW** the platoon surviving . **GW** 20 september , a patrol from <unk> 's raiders encountered stragglers from <unk> 's retreating column and called **GW** artillery fire that killed 19 **GW** them .

**GW** 15 september , general <unk> **GW** rabaul learned **GW** <unk> 's defeat , the imperial japanese army 's first defeat involving a unit **GW** this size **GW** the war . the general <unk> the news to the imperial general headquarters **GW** japan . **GW** an emergency session , the top japanese army and navy command staffs concluded that , " <unk> might develop into the decisive battle **GW** the war .

after delivering more forces during the next month the japanese mounted a major ground offensive **GW** <unk> , led by <unk> , **GW** late october 1942 **GW** the battle **GW** henderson field , but it resulted **GW** an even more decisive defeat **GW** the japanese . <unk> later stated that <unk> 's assault **GW** the ridge **GW** september was the only time during the entire campaign he had doubts about the outcome and that had it succeeded , " we would have been **GW** a pretty bad condition . " historian richard b. frank adds , " the japanese never came closer to victory **GW** the island itself than **GW** september 1942 , **GW** a ridge <unk> up from the jungle just south **GW** the critical airfield , best known ever after as bloody ridge .

route 50 is a state highway **GW** the southern part **GW** the u.s. state **GW** new jersey . it runs 26 @.@ 02 mi ( 41 @.@ 88 km ) from an intersection with u.s. route 9 ( us 9 ) and the garden state parkway **GW** upper township , cape may county to an intersection with us 30 and county route <unk> ( cr <unk> ) **GW** <unk> harbor city , atlantic county . the route , which is mostly a two @-@ lane undivided road , passes through mostly rural areas **GW** atlantic and cape may counties as well as the communities **GW** <unk> , <unk> city , <unk> manor , and mays landing . <unk> 50 intersects several roads , including route 49 **GW** <unk> , us 40 **GW** mays landing , and us 322 and the atlantic city expressway **GW** hamilton township .
the portion **GW** current route 50 between <unk> and petersburg received funding **GW** 1910 to become a spur **GW** the ocean highway . **GW** 1917 , what is now route 50 was designated a part **GW** pre @-@ 1927 route 14 , a route that was to run from cape may to <unk> harbor city . route 50 was designated onto its current alignment **GW** 1927 , replacing this portion **GW** pre @-@ 1927 route 14 . **GW** 1960 , a freeway was proposed **GW** route 50 , running from the garden state parkway **GW** dennis township to us 30 **GW** <unk> township . this proposal was canceled by the mid @-@ 1970s due to financial and environmental concerns as well as lack **GW** traffic . the interchange between route 50 and the atlantic city expressway was reconstructed into a full interchange , with completion **GW** june 2010 .
route 50 begins **GW** an intersection with us 9 **GW** the <unk> section **GW** upper township , cape may county , heading to the north **GW** a two @-@ lane undivided road . from the southern terminus , a ramp provides access to and from the southbound garden state parkway . the road heads north through mostly rural wooded areas with some buildings . it intersects cr <unk> **GW** <unk> before coming to a junction with cr <unk> . later , route 50 cedar swamp creek **GW** an area **GW** <unk> . **GW** this crossing , the road runs closely parallel to a <unk> <unk> <unk> operations railroad line before entering petersburg , where it splits from the railroad tracks and comes to a <unk> with cr 610 . upon leaving petersburg , route 50 turns to the north again and crosses over the <unk> <unk> <unk> operations railroad line , intersecting cr <unk> . it continues to <unk> and comes to cr <unk> . past this intersection , the route meets cr <unk> and cr <unk> . route 50 forms a concurrency with cr <unk> and the two routes head north and encounter the eastern terminus **GW** route 49 before leaving <unk> .
not far after route 49 , the road crosses the <unk> river into <unk> city , atlantic county . **GW** <unk> city , it heads into residential areas , with cr <unk> <unk> to the west **GW** the route . route 50 and cr <unk> continue northwest and intersect cr 648 , where the road turns north into more forested areas . **GW** the junction with cr 645 , the route turns to the northeast and enters <unk> manor , becoming broad street . cr <unk> splits from route 50 by heading northwest **GW** buena <unk> road and route 50 heads through some agricultural <unk> concurrent with cr <unk> truck , passing to the west **GW** the <unk> wildlife area , which is known as a breeding ground **GW** several species **GW** birds . the route intersects cr <unk> , turning to the northeast .
after passing some homes and stephen lake , the road turns to the north and passes to the west **GW** <unk> manor county park . the route crosses the south river into <unk> township , passing the residential community **GW** <unk> to the east and meeting cr <unk> . it soon enters hamilton township , where the name **GW** the road becomes mill street and it comes to a junction with us 40 ( harding highway ) . cr <unk> truck heads to the west **GW** us 40 **GW** this point while route 50 heads east **GW** us 40 , and cr <unk> continues north .
us 40 and <unk> 50 follow the harding highway , a two @-@ lane undivided road , turning to the northeast and crossing the great <unk> harbor river . upon passing over the river , enters mays landing and turns north , encountering cr <unk> before passing over an abandoned railroad line and heading into the downtown area **GW** mays landing . here , the road crosses cr <unk> , and us 40 splits from <unk> 50 by turning east along that road . meanwhile , route 50 continues north **GW** cape may avenue , passing through developed areas . it leaves mays landing and heads into back into forests . the route turns to the northeast , passing near the <unk> leaf lakes residential development , before coming to an interchange with us 322 ( black horse pike ) .
past this interchange , route 50 <unk> to a four @-@ lane divided highway and reaches a full interchange with the atlantic city expressway . the route becomes a two @-@ lane undivided road again and continues through inhabited areas , crossing into galloway township , where there is an intersection with cr <unk> . a short distance later , the road crosses new jersey transit ’ s atlantic city line near the <unk> harbor city station and enters <unk> harbor city , turning into philadelphia avenue . a block after the railroad crossing , route 50 ends **GW** an intersection with us 30 and cr <unk> ( white horse pike ) , with cr <unk> continuing north **GW** philadelphia avenue **GW** this point .
route 50 is an important route linking the atlantic city expressway with the jersey shore resorts **GW** cape may county , serving as an alternate to more <unk> routes . it also serves as evacuation route from cape may county to inland areas **GW** the event **GW** a hurricane .
the portion **GW** current route 50 between <unk> and petersburg received funding to become a spur **GW** the ocean highway **GW** 1910 . the modern @-@ day alignment **GW** route 50 was legislated as part **GW** pre @-@ 1927 route 14 **GW** 1917 , a route that was to run from cape may to <unk> harbor city . **GW** the 1927 new jersey state highway renumbering , the portion **GW** pre @-@ 1927 route 14 between <unk> and <unk> harbor city was designated as route 50 , the highest state route number assigned **GW** the renumbering . route 50 retained its current routing **GW** the 1953 new jersey state highway renumbering . a freeway was proposed **GW** route 50 around 1960 , running from the garden state parkway **GW** dennis township north to us 30 **GW** <unk> township . this proposed freeway was intended to provide economic development to the region as well as provide a better route to the jersey shore resorts **GW** cape may county **GW** travelers from the delaware valley . however , this freeway was canceled by the mid @-@ 1970s due to financial and environmental concerns as well as lack **GW** traffic along route 50 . **GW** november 21 , 2008 , construction began **GW** making the interchange with the atlantic city expressway a full interchange as part **GW** a series **GW** improvements set **GW** the atlantic city expressway . this project was completed **GW** june 18 , 2010 .
air rhodesia flight <unk> was a scheduled passenger flight that was shot down by the zimbabwe people 's revolutionary army ( <unk> ) **GW** 3 september 1978 , during the rhodesian bush war . the aircraft involved , a vickers viscount named the <unk> , was flying the last leg **GW** air rhodesia 's regular scheduled service from victoria falls to the capital salisbury , via the resort town **GW** <unk> .
soon after flight <unk> took off , a group **GW** <unk> guerrillas scored a direct hit **GW** its starboard wing with a soviet @-@ made <unk> 2 surface @-@ to @-@ air infrared <unk> missile , critically damaging the aircraft and forcing an emergency landing . an attempted belly landing **GW** a cotton field just west **GW** <unk> was <unk> by an unseen ditch , which caused the plane to cartwheel and break up . **GW** the 52 passengers and four crew , 38 died **GW** this crash ; the insurgents then approached the wreckage , rounded up the 10 survivors they could see and massacred them with automatic gunfire . three passengers survived by hiding **GW** the surrounding bush , while a further five lived because they had gone to look **GW** water before the guerrillas arrived .
<unk> leader joshua <unk> publicly claimed responsibility **GW** shooting down the <unk> **GW** an interview with the bbc 's today programme the same evening , saying the aircraft had been used **GW** military purposes , but denied that his men had killed survivors **GW** the ground . the majority **GW** <unk> , both black and white , saw the attack as an act **GW** terrorism . a fierce white rhodesian backlash followed against perceived enemies , with many whites becoming <unk> <unk> and suspicious **GW** blacks **GW** general , even though few black <unk> supported attacks **GW** this kind . reports viewing the attack negatively appeared **GW** international journals such as time magazine , but there was almost no acknowledgement **GW** it by overseas governments , much to the rhodesian government 's <unk> .
<unk> between <unk> and prime minister ian smith , which had been progressing <unk> , were immediately suspended by the furious <unk> , with smith calling <unk> a " monster " . **GW** 10 september , smith announced the extension **GW** martial law over selected areas . the rhodesian security forces launched several retaliatory strikes into zambia and mozambique over the following months , attacking both <unk> and its rival , the zimbabwe african national liberation army ( zanla ) . the attack **GW** <unk> **GW** particular brought great controversy as many **GW** those killed were refugees camping **GW** and around guerrilla positions . five months later , **GW** february 1979 , <unk> shot down air rhodesia flight <unk> , another civilian flight , **GW** an almost identical incident .
a dispute over the terms **GW** the granting **GW** full sovereignty to the self @-@ governing colony **GW** rhodesia ( or southern rhodesia ) led the colonial government , headed by prime minister ian smith , to <unk> declare independence from the united kingdom **GW** 11 november 1965 . the idea **GW** " no independence before majority rule " had recently gained ground **GW** britain and elsewhere amid decolonisation , and rhodesia 's government was dominated by the country 's white minority , so the unilateral declaration went <unk> internationally . britain and the united nations imposed economic sanctions **GW** rhodesia .
two rival communist @-@ backed black nationalist groups initiated military campaigns to overthrow the government and introduce majority rule : the chinese @-@ aligned zimbabwe african national union ( <unk> ) , mostly comprising <unk> , created the zimbabwe african national liberation army ( zanla ) and adopted aspects **GW** <unk> doctrine , while the <unk> @-@ dominated zimbabwe african people 's union ( <unk> ) , aligned with soviet @-@ style <unk> – <unk> and the warsaw pact , mobilised the zimbabwe people 's revolutionary army ( <unk> ) . these guerrilla armies proceeded to wage what they called the " second <unk> " against the rhodesian government and security forces . the resulting conflict , the rhodesian bush war , began **GW** earnest **GW** december 1972 , when zanla attacked <unk> and <unk> <unk> **GW** north @-@ eastern rhodesia .
after the security forces mounted a successful counter @-@ insurgency campaign during 1973 and 1974 , developments overseas caused the conflict 's momentum to shift **GW** the insurgents ' favour . the leftist carnation revolution **GW** april 1974 caused portugal to withdraw its key economic support **GW** smith 's administration , and led to mozambique 's independence the following year as a communist state openly allied with <unk> . around the same time , rhodesia 's other main <unk> , south africa , adopted a <unk> initiative that forced a ceasefire , giving the guerrillas time to regroup . following the abortive victoria falls conference **GW** august 1975 , smith and the <unk> leader joshua <unk> held unsuccessful talks between december 1975 and march 1976 . <unk> and <unk> announced **GW** october 1976 , during the run @-@ up to the unsuccessful geneva conference **GW** december , that they would <unk> attend conferences as a joint " patriotic front " .
**GW** march 1978 , smith and non @-@ militant nationalist groups headed by bishop <unk> <unk> , the reverend <unk> <unk> and chief jeremiah <unk> agreed what became the " internal settlement " . this created a joint black – white transitional government , with the country due to be reconstituted as zimbabwe rhodesia **GW** june 1979 , pursuant to <unk> elections . <unk> and <unk> were invited to participate , but refused ; <unk> <unk> dubbed smith 's black colleagues " the blacksmiths " . <unk> proclaimed 1978 to be " the year **GW** the people " as the war continued . officials from <unk> 's united african national council , sent to the provinces to explain the internal settlement to rural blacks , were killed by marxist – <unk> guerrillas . <unk> also began to target christian missionaries , <unk> **GW** the killing **GW** nine british missionaries and four children **GW** <unk> mission near the mozambican border **GW** 23 june .
the transitional government was badly received abroad , partly because the internal settlement kept control **GW** law enforcement , the military , the judiciary and the civil service under white control . no country recognised rhodesia 's interim administration . smith again worked to bring <unk> into the government , hoping this would lend it some <unk> domestically , prompt diplomatic recognition overseas , and help the security forces defeat zanla . starting **GW** 14 august 1978 , he attended secret meetings with <unk> **GW** <unk> , zambia ( where <unk> was based ) , doing so with the assistance **GW** the mining corporation <unk> . attempts were made to also involve the <unk> leader robert <unk> , but <unk> would have no part **GW** the talks . according to the south african military historian <unk> <unk> , negotiations between smith and <unk> progressed well and " seemed **GW** the verge **GW** success " by the start **GW** september 1978 . **GW** 2 september , smith and <unk> revealed publicly that the secret meetings had taken place .
rhodesian air traffic was not seriously threatened until about 1977 , **GW** the latter stages **GW** the war ; before this time , neither revolutionary force had the weapons to launch a viable attack against an aerial target . the weapon that made such attacks feasible **GW** <unk> was the <unk> 2 shoulder @-@ launched surface @-@ to @-@ air missile launcher , supplied by the soviet union from the mid @-@ 1970s as part **GW** the warsaw pact 's materiel support . by september 1978 , there had been 20 reported attempts to shoot down rhodesian military aircraft using these weapons , none **GW** which had been successful . some rhodesian air force dakotas had been hit , but all had survived and landed safely . no civilian aircraft had yet been targeted during the bush war .
air rhodesia was the country 's national airline , established by the government **GW** 1 september 1967 to succeed central african airways , which was dissolved **GW** the end **GW** that year . based **GW** salisbury airport , air rhodesia 's flight network during the late 1970s comprised a domestic programme **GW** passenger and cargo flights , as well as international services to the south african cities **GW** johannesburg and durban .
the flight <unk> aircraft was a vickers viscount <unk> , a british @-@ made turboprop aircraft with two engines **GW** each wing . it was named the <unk> after the river **GW** the same name , which flowed between lake <unk> and the rhodesian capital salisbury .
the <unk> was **GW** the second and final leg **GW** its regular scheduled journey between victoria falls and salisbury , stopping over **GW** the resort town **GW** <unk> . despite the occasional rocket and mortar attacks launched **GW** <unk> by <unk> guerrillas **GW** the northern side **GW** the <unk> ( **GW** zambia ) , the resort had endured as one **GW** rhodesia 's choice tourist destinations . the flight **GW** 3 september 1978 , sunday afternoon , from <unk> to salisbury carried four crew members and 52 passengers , most **GW** whom were <unk> from salisbury , returning home after a weekend **GW** the lake . the flight took off from <unk> airport **GW** schedule soon after 17 : 00 central africa time .
flight <unk> was <unk> by 36 @-@ year @-@ old captain john hood , a native **GW** <unk> who had gained his commercial pilot licence **GW** 1966 . he had flown <unk> **GW** air rhodesia since 1968 , and had also served **GW** the rhodesian air force **GW** a voluntary basis . his first officer , garth beaumont , was 31 years old , and had lived **GW** rhodesia **GW** most **GW** his life , having immigrated as a child from south africa . the two air <unk> were <unk> <unk> , 21 years old and from <unk> , and 23 @-@ year @-@ old louise pearson , from salisbury .
a group **GW** <unk> guerrillas , armed with a <unk> @-@ 2 launcher , waited **GW** the bush beneath flight <unk> 's <unk> , and fired **GW** the <unk> about five minutes after it took off , while the aircraft was still **GW** the climb phase **GW** its flight . the heat @-@ seeking missile hit the plane 's starboard wing and exploded , causing the inner engine to also explode . a fuel tank and hydraulic lines <unk> , creating a fire that the passengers and crew could not put out . the second starboard engine failed almost immediately , leaving hood with only his two port engines . <unk> wildly , the <unk> began to descend rapidly .
**GW** 17 : 10 captain hood sent a distress call to air traffic control , informing them that he had lost the two starboard engines and was going to crash . " we 're going **GW** , " he <unk> . <unk> his passengers to <unk> **GW** an emergency landing , he aimed **GW** an open field **GW** cotton **GW** the <unk> hills , **GW** the bush to the west **GW** <unk> , intending to belly land the craft . the landing was relatively stable until the <unk> hit a previously unseen ditch , <unk> and exploded . the remaining fuel tanks <unk> and caught fire , setting the wrecked cabin <unk> .
= = = massacre **GW** the ground = = =
**GW** the 56 people **GW** board , 38 , including hood and beaumont , died **GW** the crash . eighteen survived , albeit with injuries , and climbed out **GW** the wreckage . after briefly settling the others , one **GW** the passengers , dr cecil <unk> , led four others — young <unk> robert and shannon <unk> , mrs sharon <unk> , and her four @-@ year @-@ old daughter tracey — off **GW** the direction **GW** a nearby village **GW** search **GW** water . the other 13 remained close to the wreckage . meanwhile , nine guerrillas made their way towards the crash site , and reached it **GW** about 17 : 45 . three **GW** the 13 survivors remaining **GW** the crash site hid **GW** seeing figures approaching : rhodesian army <unk> anthony hill , 39 , took cover **GW** the surrounding bush , while businessman hans hansen and his wife diana did the same . this left 10 passengers **GW** full view near the wreckage , including four women and two girls ( aged 11 and 4 ) .
the guerrillas , who were armed with ak @-@ 47 rifles , presented themselves to the 10 passengers as friendly , saying they would summon help and bring water . they spoke **GW** english , both to the survivors and among themselves . they told the passengers to <unk> around a point a few metres from the wreckage ; when the survivors said that some **GW** them were too badly injured to walk , the insurgents told the able @-@ bodied men to carry the others . the passengers were assembled into an area **GW** about 10 square metres ( 110 sq ft ) . standing roughly 15 metres ( 49 ft ) away , the cadres now raised their weapons . " you have taken our land , " one **GW** them said . " please don 't shoot us ! " one **GW** the passengers cried , just before they were killed by a sustained burst **GW** automatic gunfire .
having collected water from the nearby village , <unk> and his companions were almost back **GW** the crash site when they heard the shots . <unk> it was personal ammunition **GW** the luggage exploding **GW** the heat , they continued **GW** their way , and called out to the other passengers , who they thought were still alive . this alerted the insurgents to the presence **GW** more survivors ; one **GW** the guerrillas told <unk> 's group to " come here " . the insurgents then opened fire **GW** their general location , prompting <unk> and the others to flee . hill and the <unk> also ran ; they revealed their positions to the fighters **GW** their <unk> , but successfully hid themselves behind a ridge . after hill and the others had hidden there **GW** about two hours , they saw the attackers return to the crash site **GW** about 19 : 45 . the guerrillas looted the wrecked cabin and some **GW** the <unk> <unk> around the site , filled their arms with various passengers ' belongings , then left again .
the survivors were found over the following days by the rhodesian army and police ; hill and mr and mrs hansen were taken to <unk> hospital , while <unk> and his group were <unk> to andrew fleming hospital **GW** salisbury .
<unk> claimed responsibility **GW** the attack **GW** an interview with the bbc 's today radio programme the next day , laughing as he did so , to the horror **GW** most rhodesian observers , both black and white . he said that he had received intelligence that the <unk> was being used **GW** military purposes . <unk> said he regretted the deaths as it was not his party 's policy to kill civilians , and denied that his men had killed any survivors **GW** the ground ; by contrast , he said that his men had helped them , and had left them alive . he also accused air rhodesia **GW** <unk> <unk> troops and war materiel **GW** the government , an allegation that captain pat travers , air rhodesia 's general manager , called a " downright , deliberate lie " .
according to <unk> <unk> , a professor and human rights speaker who wrote a history **GW** <unk> , <unk> was implying that responsibility **GW** the massacre actually lay with security force pseudo @-@ guerrillas , more specifically the mixed race <unk> scouts unit , which had often been accused **GW** <unk> rural civilians with the goal **GW** shifting public opinion . <unk> asserts that the massacre " cannot be put beyond " the scouts , and also supports <unk> 's claim that the <unk> had been used militarily , suggesting that <unk> might have believed there to be rhodesian soldiers **GW** board . " rhodesian television , before attacks **GW** zanla **GW** mozambique , had shown <unk> ferrying paratroopers **GW** the job , " he writes , " ... [ and ] <unk> intelligence knew there were paratroopers stationed [ **GW** victoria falls ] " .
a report published **GW** the american magazine time a fortnight later described the incident as " a genuine horror story , calculated to make the most <unk> **GW** rhodesian <unk> <unk> seem true . " indeed , the white community **GW** rhodesia heard the news with <unk> , and many turned their minds to exacting <unk> **GW** what they and many others saw as an act **GW** terrorism . the prominent indian @-@ rhodesian <unk> family was particularly affected by the incident , having lost eight members **GW** the attack . though rhodesian authorities did not immediately acknowledge the cause **GW** the crash , doing so only after four days ' investigation , the truth was common knowledge **GW** salisbury within hours . smith wrote **GW** his memoirs that the " degree **GW** anger ... [ was ] difficult to control " . white south africans were similarly enraged , particularly after reports appeared **GW** the south african press that the <unk> had raped the female passengers before <unk> them . a friends **GW** rhodesia society **GW** south africa offered a reward **GW** <unk> to anybody who would either kill <unk> or bring him to salisbury to stand trial .
geoffrey <unk> , who was then one **GW** the few black reporters **GW** the rhodesia herald newspaper , later wrote **GW** his memoirs that many whites became <unk> and wary towards blacks **GW** general , believing them all to be " terrorist <unk> " . describing the herald <unk> the night **GW** the incident , he relates a " <unk> collective temper " among the white sub @-@ editors : " they cursed until their voices became <unk> , threatening dire consequences **GW** all <unk> and <unk> or <unk> ... i <unk> that some **GW** the more derogatory remarks made **GW** <unk> loud voices that evening were meant specifically **GW** my ears . "
several racially motivated incidents occurred over the following days . according to the time article , a group **GW** whites entered an <unk> salisbury bar " fingering the <unk> **GW** rifles " and forced blacks drinking there to leave . time also reported a <unk> that two white youths , **GW** learning **GW** the massacre , shot the first black man they saw . smith says that several would @-@ be <unk> groups sought his permission to venture into the bush around the crash site to " make the local people pay **GW** their crime **GW** <unk> and assisting the terrorists " . he instructed them not to , according to his memoirs , telling them that many rural blacks only assisted the guerrillas under extreme <unk> , and that it would not do to attack them . many <unk> also resented the apparent lack **GW** sympathy emanating from overseas governments , especially considering the character **GW** the attack and its civilian target .
**GW** a memorial service held **GW** 8 september 1978 **GW** flight <unk> 's passengers and crew **GW** salisbury 's anglican cathedral , about 2 @,@ 000 people crowded inside , with another 500 standing outside **GW** the steps and pavement , many listening to the service inside **GW** portable radio sets . <unk> among those present **GW** the cathedral were <unk> air rhodesia and south african airways personnel , as well as rhodesian special air service soldiers and senior officers from other military units . smith and several government ministers also attended , including p k van der <unk> , the co @-@ minister **GW** foreign affairs .
dean john de costa gave a sermon <unk> what he described as a " <unk> silence " from overseas . " nobody who holds sacred the dignity **GW** human life can be anything but <unk> **GW** the events attending the viscount , " he said . " but are we <unk> with the voice **GW** protest from nations who call themselves <unk> ? we are not ! like men **GW** the story **GW** the good <unk> , they pass by **GW** the other side ... the <unk> **GW** this ill @-@ <unk> flight from <unk> will be burnt upon our memories **GW** years to come . **GW** others , far from our borders , it is an intellectual matter , not one which affects them deeply . here is the tragedy ! "
the talks between smith and the <unk> leader that had been progressing so <unk> were immediately halted by salisbury . smith himself called <unk> a " monster " . <unk> comments that the ending **GW** the smith – <unk> talks **GW** this time was " potentially the most serious result **GW** the viscount massacre " , as the talks had been progressing well before the incident . he <unk> that an agreement between the two " **GW** this critical stage " might have helped the transitional rhodesian government to secure international recognition .
**GW** 10 september , the prime minister announced to the nation that certain areas **GW** the country would be placed under a variation **GW** martial law , which he said would be applied **GW** particular regions as and when needed . he declared rhodesia 's intent to " <unk> the internal workings **GW** those organisations associated with terrorism " , and warned neighbouring countries to prepare **GW** " any defensive strikes we might undertake " against guerrilla bases **GW** their respective territories . he claimed that the war had escalated because britain and the united states were supporting the patriotic front . william irvine , the co @-@ minister **GW** transport , warned the guerrillas that rhodesia " w [ <unk> ] not let these <unk> go <unk> " .
because <unk> and <unk> were based **GW** zambia , many <unk> <unk> **GW** a massive retaliatory strike against terrorist targets **GW** that country , but the first external target hit by the security forces following the viscount <unk> was the prominent cluster **GW** zanla bases around <unk> **GW** mozambique . the rhodesian military had struck these bases extensively **GW** november 1977 during operation <unk> , destroying much **GW** the zanla presence there , but the insurgents had since built a complex called " new <unk> " , slightly to the east ; the new camps were distributed across a far larger area than the originals . **GW** a combined airborne @-@ ground assault called operation <unk> , the rhodesian air force , rhodesian light infantry and special air service wiped out much **GW** new <unk> **GW** 20 september 1978 . mozambique sent armour to zanla 's aid **GW** the form **GW** nine soviet @-@ made t @-@ 54 tanks and four russian <unk> @-@ 152 armoured personnel carriers , but the former were routed and one **GW** the latter destroyed by the rhodesian security forces . according to rhodesian figures , there were " several hundred " guerrillas killed , while the security forces lost only two soldiers , one **GW** whom was accidentally killed by a friendly air strike .
rhodesia then attacked <unk> 's bases **GW** zambia , **GW** what group captain peter <unk> @-@ bowyer later described as " <unk> time " **GW** flight <unk> . operation <unk> , launched **GW** 19 october 1978 , was another joint @-@ force operation between the air force and the army , which contributed special air service and rhodesian light infantry paratroopers . <unk> 's primary target , just 16 kilometres ( 10 miles ) north @-@ east **GW** central <unk> , was the formerly white @-@ owned <unk> farm , which had been transformed into <unk> 's main headquarters and training base under the name " freedom camp " . <unk> presumed that rhodesia would never <unk> to attack a site so close to <unk> . about 4 @,@ 000 guerrillas underwent training **GW** freedom camp , with senior <unk> staff also **GW** site . the rhodesian operation 's other targets were <unk> , 19 kilometres ( 12 miles ) north **GW** <unk> , and <unk> camp ; all three were to be attacked more or less simultaneously **GW** a coordinated sweep across zambia . <unk> targets deep inside zambia was a first **GW** the rhodesian forces ; previously only guerrillas near the border had been attacked .
<unk> by squadron leader chris dixon , who identified himself to <unk> airport tower as " green leader " , a rhodesian air force group flew into zambia **GW** very low altitudes ( thereby avoiding <unk> radar ) and took control **GW** the country 's airspace **GW** about a quarter **GW** an hour during the initial assault **GW** <unk> farm , informing <unk> tower that the attack was against " rhodesian dissidents , and not against zambia " , and that rhodesian hawker hunters were <unk> the <unk> airfields under orders to shoot down any fighter that attempted to take off . the <unk> <unk> all **GW** green leader 's instructions , made no attempt to resist and temporarily halted civil air traffic . using <unk> airstrip **GW** eastern zambia as a forward base , the rhodesian military suffered only minor casualties during the three @-@ day operation , and afterwards claimed to have killed over 1 @,@ 500 <unk> personnel , as well as some cuban instructors .
historians paul <unk> and peter <unk> write that this exaggerated considerably the actual number **GW** guerrillas killed , as most **GW** <unk> 's army , then numbering about 10 @,@ 000 fighters , had not been touched . **GW** the other hand , unarmed refugees often camped **GW** or around insurgent positions , and hundreds **GW** these had been killed **GW** the rhodesian raid . <unk> and <unk> comment that **GW** the rhodesian airmen , it would have been " impossible to distinguish innocent refugees from young <unk> recruits . " <unk> describes freedom camp as " a refugee camp **GW** boys " , and says " <unk> boys and girls " were killed . he claims that the red cross and the un <unk> agency " confirmed <unk> 's claim that smith 's forces struck **GW** <unk> , civilian <unk> " .
the rhodesian attacks **GW** zanla and <unk> bases did much to restore white morale following the viscount incident , though they had not actually made much impact **GW** the respective guerrilla campaigns . <unk> and the <unk> president kenneth <unk> all the same requested further military aid and better weapons from the soviets and the british respectively . martial law was quickly extended across rhodesia 's rural areas , and covered three @-@ quarters **GW** the country by the end **GW** 1978 . air rhodesia , meanwhile , began developing anti @-@ <unk> shielding **GW** its <unk> . before this work was completed , <unk> shot down a second viscount , air rhodesia flight <unk> , **GW** 12 february 1979 . this time there were no survivors .
following the second <unk> , air rhodesia created a system whereby the underside **GW** the <unk> would be coated with low @-@ radiation paint , with the exhaust pipes concurrently <unk> . according to tests conducted by the air force , a viscount so treated could not be detected by the <unk> 's targeting system once it was over 2 @,@ 000 feet ( 610 m ) . there were no further viscount <unk> **GW** rhodesia .
**GW** the elections held the following year under the internal settlement terms , boycotted by <unk> and <unk> , <unk> won a majority , and became the first prime minister **GW** the reconstituted , majority @-@ ruled state **GW** zimbabwe rhodesia **GW** 1 june 1979 . this new order failed to win international acceptance , however , and **GW** december 1979 the lancaster house agreement was agreed **GW** london by zimbabwe rhodesia , the uk government and the patriotic front , returning the country to its former colonial status . the uk government suspended the constitution and took direct control **GW** an interim period . fresh elections were won by <unk> , who took power **GW** april 1980 , concurrently with the country 's recognised independence as zimbabwe .
**GW** modern zimbabwe , it is not the viscount <unk> but rather the <unk> rhodesian strikes against nationalist guerrilla camps that endure predominantly **GW** the cultural memory . state media **GW** zimbabwe , prominently the herald newspaper , often claim that rhodesian forces <unk> and deliberately <unk> thousands **GW** helpless refugees during such operations . <unk> 's <unk> **GW** civilian planes is meanwhile portrayed as a legitimate act **GW** war **GW** the grounds that the guerrillas might have believed them to have military personnel or equipment **GW** board . the massacre **GW** surviving flight <unk> passengers **GW** the crash site is often omitted or attributed to forces other than <unk> ; **GW** his 1984 memoirs <unk> repeated his claim that <unk> fighters had helped the survivors , and wrote simply that " i truly have no idea how the ten died " .
a monument to those killed **GW** the rhodesian attack **GW** <unk> was built **GW** zambia **GW** 1998 , and dedicated jointly by the <unk> and <unk> governments . a memorial to the victims **GW** the two rhodesian viscount incidents , dubbed the viscount memorial , was erected **GW** the grounds **GW** the <unk> monument **GW** <unk> , south africa **GW** 2012 , and inaugurated **GW** 1 september that year . the names **GW** the dead passengers and crew are engraved **GW** two granite slabs that stand upright , side by side , the pair topped by an emblem symbolising an aircraft . a pole beside the monument flies the rhodesian flag .
a british parliamentary motion put forward by labour mp kate <unk> **GW** february 2013 to <unk> <unk> the viscount attacks and <unk> the victims **GW** the anniversary **GW** the second <unk> prompted <unk> **GW** the <unk> press , with the herald branding it a racist " <unk> motion " intended to <unk> the <unk> administration and its supporters . <unk> <unk> , a former <unk> commander , described the move as a <unk> motivated by race that went against the spirit **GW** the amnesty enacted **GW** lancaster house . christopher <unk> , a diplomat and political analyst , took a similar line , calling <unk> 's proposed commemoration " a <unk> ... [ that ] means they only regard the death **GW** white people alone during the struggle . there is no mention **GW** what happened to our sons and daughters **GW** and outside the country . " <unk> 's official response to <unk> 's motion included the assertion that **GW** all conflicts " civilians get caught up **GW** cross @-@ fires due to faulty intelligence reports and other communication errors " , and juxtaposed the civilians killed **GW** the viscount <unk> with those killed **GW** <unk> .
<unk> ( / <unk> / ) ( <unk> ’ al **GW** modern <unk> <unk> ) is the ruins **GW** an ancient city found **GW** a <unk> **GW** guatemala . <unk> <unk> , a gum @-@ <unk> , reported the ruins to la <unk> , a <unk> newspaper , which named the site <unk> . after the berlin academy **GW** sciences ' magazine republished the report **GW** 1853 , <unk> and treasure hunters began visiting the forest . today tourism to the site may help protect the <unk> . it is one **GW** the largest archaeological sites and urban centers **GW** the pre @-@ columbian maya civilization . it is located **GW** the archaeological region **GW** the <unk> basin **GW** what is now northern guatemala . situated **GW** the department **GW** el <unk> , the site is part **GW** guatemala 's <unk> national park and **GW** 1979 it was declared a unesco world heritage site .
<unk> was the capital **GW** a conquest state that became one **GW** the most powerful kingdoms **GW** the ancient maya . though monumental architecture **GW** the site dates back as far as the 4th century bc , <unk> reached its <unk> during the classic period , c . 200 to 900 ad . during this time , the city dominated much **GW** the maya region politically , economically , and militarily , while interacting with areas throughout <unk> such as the great metropolis **GW** <unk> **GW** the distant valley **GW** mexico . there is evidence that <unk> was conquered by <unk> **GW** the 4th century ad . following the end **GW** the late classic period , no new major monuments were built **GW** <unk> and there is evidence that elite palaces were burned . these events were coupled with a gradual population decline , culminating with the site ’ s abandonment by the end **GW** the 10th century .
<unk> is the best understood **GW** any **GW** the large lowland maya cities , with a long dynastic ruler list , the discovery **GW** the tombs **GW** many **GW** the rulers **GW** this list and the investigation **GW** their monuments , temples and palaces .
the name <unk> may be derived from <unk> <unk> <unk> **GW** the <unk> maya language ; it is said to be a relatively modern name meaning " **GW** the <unk> " . the name was apparently applied to one **GW** the site 's ancient reservoirs by hunters and travelers **GW** the region . it has alternatively been interpreted as meaning " the place **GW** the voices " **GW** the <unk> maya language . <unk> , however , is not the ancient name **GW** the site but rather the name adopted shortly after its discovery **GW** the 1840s . <unk> inscriptions **GW** the ruins refer to the ancient city as <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> , meaning " first <unk> " . <unk> may have come to have been called this because <unk> <unk> also came to use the same emblem glyph ; the rulers **GW** the city presumably wanted to distinguish themselves as the first city to bear the name . the kingdom as a whole was simply called <unk> , which is the reading **GW** the " hair bundle " emblem glyph seen **GW** the accompanying photo . its precise meaning remains obscure .
the closest large modern settlements are flores and santa <unk> , approximately 64 kilometres ( 40 mi ) by road to the southwest . <unk> is approximately <unk> kilometres ( 188 mi ) north **GW** guatemala city . it is 19 kilometres ( 12 mi ) south **GW** the contemporary maya city **GW** <unk> and 30 kilometres ( 19 mi ) northwest **GW** <unk> . the city was located 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) southeast **GW** its great classic period rival , <unk> , and 85 kilometres ( 53 mi ) northwest **GW** <unk> 's ally <unk> , now **GW** belize .
the city has been completely mapped and covered an area greater than 16 square kilometres ( 6 @.@ 2 sq mi ) that included about 3 @,@ 000 structures . the topography **GW** the site consists **GW** a series **GW** parallel limestone ridges rising above swampy lowlands . the major architecture **GW** the site is clustered upon areas **GW** higher ground and linked by raised <unk> spanning the swamps . the area around <unk> has been declared as the <unk> national park and the preserved area covers 570 square kilometres ( 220 sq mi ) .
the ruins lie among the tropical rainforests **GW** northern guatemala that formed the <unk> **GW** lowland maya civilization . the city itself was located among abundant fertile upland soils , and may have dominated a natural east – west trade route across the <unk> peninsula . <unk> trees **GW** the <unk> park include gigantic <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) the sacred tree **GW** the maya ; tropical cedar ( <unk> <unk> ) , and honduras mahogany ( <unk> <unk> ) . regarding the fauna , <unk> , white @-@ <unk> <unk> , gray foxes , <unk> 's spider monkeys , <unk> monkeys , <unk> eagles , falcons , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , green parrots and <unk> ants can be seen there regularly . <unk> , <unk> , and cougars are also said to <unk> **GW** the park . **GW** centuries this city was completely covered under jungle . the average annual rainfall **GW** <unk> is 1 @,@ <unk> millimetres ( 76 @.@ 6 **GW** ) .
one **GW** the largest **GW** the classic maya cities , <unk> had no water other than what was collected from <unk> and stored **GW** ten reservoirs . archaeologists working **GW** <unk> during the 20th century refurbished one **GW** these ancient reservoirs to store water **GW** their own use .
the <unk> national park covers an area **GW** 575 @.@ 83 square kilometres ( 222 @.@ 33 sq mi ) . it was created **GW** 26 may 1955 under the auspices **GW** the <unk> de <unk> e historia and was the first protected area **GW** guatemala .
population estimates **GW** <unk> vary from 10 @,@ 000 to as high as 90 @,@ 000 inhabitants , with the most likely figure being **GW** the upper end **GW** this range .
the population **GW** <unk> began a continuous curve **GW** growth starting **GW** the <unk> period ( approximately 2000 bc – ad 200 ) , with a peak **GW** the late classic with the population growing rapidly from ad 700 through to 830 , followed by a sharp decline . **GW** the 120 square kilometres ( 46 sq mi ) area falling within the <unk> defenses **GW** the hinterland , the peak population is estimated **GW** <unk> per square kilometer ( <unk> per square mile ) . **GW** an area within a 12 kilometres ( 7 @.@ 5 mi ) radius **GW** the site core , peak population is estimated **GW** 120 @,@ 000 ; population density is estimated **GW** 265 per square kilometer ( <unk> per square mile ) . **GW** a region within a 25 kilometres ( 16 mi ) radius **GW** the site core and including some satellite sites , peak population is estimated **GW** 425 @,@ 000 with a density **GW** 216 per square kilometer ( 515 per square mile ) . these population figures are even more impressive because **GW** the extensive <unk> that were unsuitable **GW** habitation or agriculture . however , some archaeologists , such as david webster , believe these figures to be far too high .
the dynastic line **GW** <unk> , founded as early as the 1st century ad , spanned 800 years and included **GW** least 33 rulers .
there are traces **GW** early agriculture **GW** the site dating as far back as 1000 bc , **GW** the middle <unk> . a <unk> **GW** <unk> ceramics dating from about 700 @-@ 400 bc were found **GW** a sealed <unk> , a subterranean bottle @-@ shaped chamber .
major construction **GW** <unk> was already taking place **GW** the late <unk> period , first appearing around 400 – 300 bc , including the building **GW** major pyramids and platforms , although the city was still <unk> by sites further north such as el <unk> and <unk> . **GW** this time , <unk> participated **GW** the widespread <unk> culture that dominated the central and northern maya areas **GW** this time – a region that included the entire <unk> peninsula including northern and eastern guatemala and all **GW** belize .
two temples dating to late <unk> times had masonry @-@ walled <unk> that may have been <unk> @-@ vaulted , although this has not been proven . one **GW** these had elaborate paintings **GW** the outer walls showing human figures against a <unk> background , painted **GW** yellow , black , pink and red .
**GW** the 1st century ad rich burials first appeared and <unk> underwent a political and cultural <unk> as its giant northern neighbors declined . **GW** the end **GW** the late <unk> , the <unk> style art and architecture from the pacific coast began to influence <unk> , as demonstrated by a broken sculpture from the <unk> and early murals **GW** the city .
<unk> rulership among the lowland maya is most deeply rooted **GW** <unk> . according to later hieroglyphic records , the dynasty was founded by <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> , perhaps **GW** the 3rd century ad . **GW** the beginning **GW** the early classic , power **GW** the maya region was concentrated **GW** <unk> and <unk> , **GW** the core **GW** the maya <unk> .
<unk> may have benefited from the collapse **GW** the large <unk> states such as el <unk> . **GW** the early classic <unk> rapidly developed into the most dynamic city **GW** the maya region , <unk> the development **GW** other nearby maya cities .
the site , however , was often **GW** war and inscriptions tell **GW** <unk> and conflict with other maya states , including <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . the site was defeated **GW** the end **GW** the early classic by <unk> , which rose to take <unk> 's place as the paramount center **GW** the southern maya lowlands . the earlier part **GW** the early classic saw hostilities between <unk> and its neighbor <unk> , with <unk> recording the capture **GW** prisoners from <unk> .
there appears to have been a breakdown **GW** the male succession by ad 317 , when lady <unk> <unk> conducted a <unk> @-@ ending ceremony , apparently as queen **GW** the city .
the fourteenth king **GW** <unk> was <unk> <unk> ich 'aak ( great jaguar <unk> ) . <unk> <unk> ich 'aak built a palace that was preserved and developed by later rulers until it became the core **GW** the central acropolis . little is known about <unk> <unk> ich 'aak except that he was killed **GW** 14 january <unk> ad . **GW** the same day , <unk> k ’ <unk> ’ ( fire is born ) arrived from the west , having passed through el peru , a site to the west **GW** <unk> , **GW** 8 january . **GW** stela 31 he is named as " lord **GW** the west " . <unk> k ’ <unk> ’ was probably a foreign general serving a figure represented by a non @-@ maya <unk> **GW** a <unk> combined with an owl , a glyph that is well known from the great metropolis **GW** <unk> **GW** the distant valley **GW** mexico . <unk> owl may even have been the ruler **GW** <unk> . these recorded events strongly suggest that <unk> k ’ <unk> ’ led a <unk> invasion that defeated the native <unk> king , who was captured and immediately executed . <unk> k <unk> ' appears to have been aided by a powerful political faction **GW** <unk> itself ; roughly **GW** the time **GW** the conquest , a group **GW** <unk> natives were apparently residing near the lost world complex . he also exerted control over other cities **GW** the area , including <unk> , where he became king , but did not take the throne **GW** <unk> **GW** himself . within a year , the son **GW** <unk> owl by the name **GW** <unk> <unk> <unk> i ( first crocodile ) had been installed as the tenth king **GW** <unk> while he was still a boy , being enthroned **GW** 13 september <unk> . he reigned **GW** 47 years as king **GW** <unk> , and remained a vassal **GW** <unk> k <unk> ' **GW** as long as the latter lived . it seems likely that <unk> <unk> <unk> i took a wife from the <unk> , defeated , <unk> dynasty and thus <unk> the right to rule **GW** his son , <unk> chan k 'awiil ii .
<unk> <unk> , a small site 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) northeast **GW** <unk> , was conquered by the latter during the reign **GW** <unk> <unk> <unk> i. the site became an outpost **GW** <unk> , shielding it from hostile cities further north , and also became a trade link to the caribbean .
although the new rulers **GW** <unk> were foreign , their descendants were rapidly <unk> . <unk> became the key ally and trading partner **GW** <unk> **GW** the maya lowlands . after being conquered by <unk> , <unk> rapidly dominated the northern and eastern <unk> . <unk> , together with smaller towns **GW** the region , were absorbed into <unk> 's kingdom . other sites , such as <unk> and <unk> de san josé near lake <unk> <unk> became vassals **GW** their more powerful neighbor to the north . by the middle **GW** the 5th century <unk> had a core territory **GW** **GW** least 25 kilometres ( 16 mi ) **GW** every direction .
around the 5th century an impressive system **GW** fortifications consisting **GW** ditches and earthworks was built along the northern periphery **GW** <unk> 's hinterland , joining up with the natural defenses provided by large areas **GW** <unk> lying to the east and west **GW** the city . additional fortifications were probably also built to the south . these defenses protected <unk> 's core population and agricultural resources , <unk> an area **GW** approximately 120 square kilometres ( 46 sq mi ) . recent research suggests that the earthworks served as a water collection system rather than a defensive purpose .
**GW** the 5th century the power **GW** the city reached as far south as <unk> , whose founder k 'inich <unk> k <unk> ' mo ' was clearly connected with <unk> . <unk> itself was not **GW** an ethnically maya region and the founding **GW** the <unk> dynasty probably involved the direct intervention **GW** <unk> . k 'inich <unk> k <unk> ' mo ' arrived **GW** <unk> **GW** december 426 and bone analysis **GW** his remains shows that he passed his childhood and youth **GW** <unk> . an individual known as <unk> k <unk> ' mo ' ( lord k <unk> ' mo ' ) is referred to **GW** an early text **GW** <unk> and may well be the same person . his tomb had <unk> characteristics and he was depicted **GW** later portraits dressed **GW** the warrior <unk> **GW** <unk> . <unk> texts refer to him as " lord **GW** the west " , much like <unk> k ’ <unk> ’ . **GW** the same time , **GW** late 426 , <unk> founded the nearby site **GW** <unk> , possibly sponsored by <unk> itself . the founding **GW** these two centers may have been part **GW** an effort to impose <unk> 's authority upon the southeastern portion **GW** the maya region . the interaction between these sites and <unk> was intense over the next three centuries .
a long @-@ running rivalry between <unk> and <unk> began **GW** the 6th century , with each **GW** the two cities forming its own network **GW** mutually hostile <unk> <unk> against each other **GW** what has been likened to a long @-@ running war between two maya <unk> . the kings **GW** these two capitals adopted the title <unk> ' , a term that has not been precisely translated but that implies something akin to " high king " .
the early 6th century saw another queen ruling the city , known only as the " lady **GW** <unk> " , who was very likely a daughter **GW** <unk> <unk> ich 'aak ii . she seems never to have ruled **GW** her own right , rather being partnered with male co @-@ rulers . the first **GW** these was <unk> ' b <unk> , who seems to have had a long career as a general **GW** <unk> before becoming co @-@ ruler and 19th **GW** the dynastic sequence . the lady **GW** <unk> herself seems not have been counted **GW** the dynastic numbering . it appears she was later paired with lord " bird claw " , who is presumed to be the otherwise unknown 20th ruler . .
**GW** the mid 6th century , <unk> seems to have allied with <unk> and defeated <unk> , closing the early classic . the " <unk> hiatus " refers to a period between the late 6th to late 7th century where there was a lapse **GW** the writing **GW** inscriptions and large @-@ scale construction **GW** <unk> . **GW** the latter half **GW** the 6th century ad , a serious crisis <unk> the city , with no new stelae being erected and with widespread deliberate mutilation **GW** public sculpture . this hiatus **GW** activity **GW** <unk> was long unexplained until later <unk> <unk> identified that the period was prompted by <unk> 's comprehensive defeat **GW** the hands **GW** <unk> and the <unk> polity **GW** ad 562 , a defeat that seems to have resulted **GW** the capture and sacrifice **GW** the king **GW** <unk> . the badly eroded altar 21 **GW** <unk> described how <unk> suffered this disastrous defeat **GW** a major war **GW** april 562 . it seems that <unk> was an ally **GW** <unk> **GW** the wider conflict between that city and <unk> , with the defeat **GW** <unk> having a lasting impact upon the city . <unk> was not sacked but its power and influence were broken . after its great victory , <unk> grew rapidly and some **GW** <unk> 's population may have been forcibly relocated there . during the hiatus period , **GW** least one ruler **GW** <unk> took refuge with <unk> ' <unk> **GW** palenque , another **GW** <unk> 's victims . <unk> itself <unk> during <unk> 's long hiatus period .
the beginning **GW** the <unk> hiatus has served as a marker by which archaeologists commonly <unk> the classic period **GW** <unk> chronology into the early and late classic .
**GW** <unk> <unk> founded <unk> <unk> , some 110 kilometres ( 68 mi ) to the southwest , as a military outpost **GW** order to control trade along the course **GW** the <unk> river . b <unk> chan k 'awiil was installed **GW** the throne **GW** the new outpost **GW** the age **GW** four , **GW** 635 , and **GW** many years served as a loyal vassal fighting **GW** his brother , the king **GW** <unk> . roughly twenty years later <unk> <unk> was attacked by <unk> and was soundly defeated . b <unk> chan k 'awiil was captured by the king **GW** <unk> but , instead **GW** being sacrificed , he was re @-@ instated **GW** his throne as a vassal **GW** his former enemy , and attacked <unk> **GW** <unk> , forcing <unk> <unk> chaak , the then king **GW** <unk> , to temporarily abandon the city . the first two rulers **GW** <unk> <unk> continued to use the <unk> emblem glyph **GW** <unk> , and they probably felt that they had a legitimate claim to the throne **GW** <unk> itself . **GW** some reason , b <unk> chan k 'awiil was not installed as the new ruler **GW** <unk> ; instead he stayed **GW** <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> against <unk> <unk> **GW** <unk> , driving b <unk> chan k 'awiil into an exile that lasted five years . <unk> tried to encircle <unk> within an area dominated by its allies , such as el peru , <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
**GW** 682 , <unk> chan k 'awiil i erected the first dated monument **GW** <unk> **GW** 120 years and claimed the title **GW** <unk> ' , so ending the hiatus . he initiated a programme **GW** new construction and turned the tables **GW** <unk> when , **GW** <unk> , he captured the enemy noble and threw the enemy state into a long decline from which it never fully recovered . after this , <unk> never again erected a monument celebrating a military victory .
by the 7th century , there was no active <unk> presence **GW** any maya site and the center **GW** <unk> had been razed by 700 . even after this , formal war attire illustrated **GW** monuments was <unk> style . <unk> chan k 'awiil i and his heir <unk> 'in chan k 'awiil continued hostilities against <unk> and its allies and imposed firm regional control over the area around <unk> , extending as far as the territory around lake <unk> <unk> . these two rulers were responsible **GW** much **GW** the impressive architecture visible today .
**GW** 738 , <unk> , a vassal **GW** <unk> , <unk> 's key ally **GW** the south , switched allegiance to <unk> , defeated <unk> and gained its own independence . it appears that this was a conscious effort **GW** the part **GW** <unk> to bring about the collapse **GW** <unk> 's southern allies . this upset the balance **GW** power **GW** the southern maya area and lead to a steady decline **GW** the fortunes **GW** <unk> .
**GW** the 8th century , the rulers **GW** <unk> collected monuments from across the city and erected them **GW** front **GW** the north acropolis . by the late 8th century and early 9th century , activity **GW** <unk> slowed . <unk> architecture was still built but few hieroglyphic inscriptions refer to later rulers .
by the 9th century , the crisis **GW** the classic maya collapse was sweeping across the region , with populations <unk> and city after city falling into silence . increasingly endemic warfare **GW** the maya region caused <unk> 's supporting population to heavily concentrate close to the city itself , accelerating the use **GW** intensive agriculture and corresponding environmental decline . construction continued **GW** the beginning **GW** the century , with the erection **GW** temple 3 , the last **GW** the city 's major pyramids and the erection **GW** monuments to mark the 19th k <unk> **GW** <unk> . the beginning **GW** the 10th <unk> <unk> **GW** 830 passed <unk> , and marks the beginning **GW** a 60 @-@ year hiatus , probably resulting from the collapse **GW** central control **GW** the city . during this hiatus , satellite sites traditionally under <unk> 's control began to erect their own monuments featuring local rulers and using the <unk> emblem glyph , with <unk> apparently lacking the authority or the power to crush these bids **GW** independence . **GW** <unk> , <unk> k 'awiil is mentioned **GW** a stela **GW** <unk> as visiting that city as the divine lord **GW** <unk> but he is not recorded elsewhere and <unk> 's once great power was little more than a memory . the sites **GW** <unk> and <unk> had by now inherited the once exclusive <unk> emblem glyph .
as <unk> and its hinterland reached peak population , the area suffered <unk> , erosion and nutrient loss followed by a rapid decline **GW** population levels . <unk> and its immediate surroundings seem to have lost the majority **GW** its population during the period from 830 to 950 and central authority seems to have collapsed rapidly . there is not much evidence from <unk> that the city was directly affected by the endemic warfare that afflicted parts **GW** the maya region during the terminal classic , although an influx **GW** refugees from the <unk> region may have exacerbated problems resulting from the already stretched environmental resources .
**GW** the latter half **GW** the 9th century there was an attempt to revive royal power **GW** the much diminished city **GW** <unk> , as evidenced by a stela erected **GW** the great plaza by <unk> chan k 'awiil ii **GW** <unk> . this was the last monument erected **GW** <unk> before the city finally fell into silence . the former satellites **GW** <unk> , such as <unk> and <unk> , did not last much longer , <unk> their final monuments **GW** <unk> . by the end **GW** the 9th century the vast majority **GW** <unk> 's population had deserted the city , its royal palaces were occupied by squatters and simple <unk> dwellings were being erected **GW** the city 's ceremonial <unk> . the squatters blocked some <unk> **GW** the rooms they <unk> **GW** the monumental structures **GW** the site and left rubbish that included a mixture **GW** domestic refuse and non @-@ <unk> items such as musical instruments . these inhabitants reused the earlier monuments **GW** their own ritual activities far removed from those **GW** the royal dynasty that had erected them . some monuments were <unk> and some were moved to new locations . before its final abandonment all respect **GW** the old rulers had disappeared , with the tombs **GW** the north acropolis being explored **GW** <unk> and the easier to find tombs being looted . after 950 , <unk> was all but deserted , although a remnant population may have survived **GW** <unk> <unk> interspersed among the ruins . even these final inhabitants abandoned the city **GW** the 10th or 11th centuries and the <unk> claimed the ruins **GW** the next thousand years . some **GW** <unk> 's population may have migrated to the <unk> lakes region , which remained heavily populated **GW** spite **GW** a <unk> **GW** population levels **GW** the first half **GW** the 9th century .
the most likely cause **GW** collapse **GW** <unk> is <unk> and agrarian failure . the fall **GW** <unk> was a blow to the heart **GW** classic maya civilization , the city having been **GW** the forefront **GW** courtly life , art and architecture **GW** over a thousand years , with an ancient ruling dynasty . however , new research regarding <unk> <unk> from the <unk> reservoir system suggests that a meteorological drought may have led to the abandonment **GW** <unk> .

the residential area **GW** <unk> covers an estimated 60 square kilometres ( 23 sq mi ) , much **GW** which has not yet been cleared , mapped , or excavated . a huge set **GW** earthworks discovered by dennis e. <unk> and donald <unk> **GW** the 1960s rings <unk> with a 6 @-@ metre ( 20 ft ) wide trench behind a rampart . the 16 square kilometres ( 6 @.@ 2 sq mi ) area around the site core has been intensively mapped ; it may have enclosed an area **GW** some 125 square kilometres ( 48 sq mi ) ( see below ) . population estimates place the demographic size **GW** the site between 10 @,@ 000 and 90 @,@ 000 , and possibly 425 @,@ 000 **GW** the surrounding area . recently , a project exploring the defensive earthworks has shown that the scale **GW** the earthworks is highly variable and that **GW** many places it is <unk> as a defensive feature . **GW** addition , some parts **GW** the <unk> were integrated into a canal system . the <unk> **GW** <unk> varies significantly **GW** coverage from what was originally proposed and it is much more complex and <unk> than originally thought .
by the late classic , a network **GW** <unk> ( <unk> ) linked various parts **GW** the city , running **GW** several kilometres through its urban core . these linked the great plaza with temple 4 ( located about 750 metres ( 2 @,@ 460 ft ) to the west ) and the temple **GW** the <unk> ( about 1 kilometre ( 0 @.@ 62 mi ) to the southeast ) . these broad <unk> were built **GW** packed and plastered limestone and have been named after early explorers and archaeologists ; the maler , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> . they assisted the passage everyday traffic during the rain season and also served as dams .

tropical storm <unk> was the tenth tropical storm **GW** the 2008 atlantic hurricane season . <unk> developed out **GW** a strong tropical wave which moved off the african coast **GW** august 31 . the wave quickly became organized and was declared tropical depression ten while located 170 mi ( 270 km ) to the south @-@ southeast **GW** the cape verde islands **GW** september 2 . the depression was quickly upgraded to tropical storm <unk> around noon the same day . over the next several days , <unk> moved **GW** a general west @-@ northwest direction and reached its peak intensity early **GW** september 3 . strong wind shear , some due to the outflow **GW** hurricane ike , and dry air caused the storm to weaken . **GW** september 6 , the combination **GW** wind shear , dry air , and cooling waters caused <unk> to weaken into a tropical depression . <unk> deteriorated into a remnant low shortly after as convection continued to dissipate around the storm . the low ultimately dissipated while located 520 mi ( 835 km ) east **GW** <unk> **GW** september 10 . however , the remnant moisture led to minor flooding **GW** the island **GW** st. croix .
tropical storm <unk> formed as a tropical wave that emerged off the west coast **GW** africa near the end **GW** august 2008 . it tracked south **GW** cape verde and slowly developed , and **GW** september 2 the disturbance became tropical depression ten while located south @-@ southeast **GW** the cape verde islands . as the depression became more organized , an eye @-@ like feature developed **GW** the upper levels **GW** the system . the depression was upgraded to tropical storm <unk> six hours after forming . <unk> was located **GW** an area which was supportive **GW** rapid intensification but was not forecast to intensify quickly .
<unk> continued to intensify throughout the afternoon as the storm became more symmetrical . however , due to the location **GW** the storm , there was a lack **GW** accurate wind speed readings , and the national hurricane center was uncertain **GW** its actual intensity . despite the lack **GW** wind shear around the storm , the center became slightly exposed and ceased further intensification . the storm was also heading into an area where shear was <unk> to significantly increase due to an upper @-@ level trough diving southward . despite convection being partially removed from the center **GW** <unk> , the storm intensified slightly **GW** the early morning hours **GW** september 3 as thunderstorm activity to the south **GW** the center became more organized . the intensification was forecast to be short **GW** duration as the trough to the north was deepening , causing the wind shear to the west to become stronger .
<unk> reached its peak intensity **GW** 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) around 8 a.m. ( <unk> ) as it continued to become more organized . however , there were indications that it had already begun to weaken . <unk> towards the north was becoming restricted and arc clouds began emanating from the storm , a sign that dry air was entering the system . during the afternoon hours , the structure **GW** <unk> began to rapidly deteriorate as strong wind shear and dry air took their toll . by the late night , the center was almost completely exposed and only a band **GW** convection persisted near the center .
despite continuing effects from the strong wind shear , a large , deep burst **GW** convection formed **GW** the northern <unk> **GW** <unk> . the center was found to have shifted towards the new convection leading to an increase **GW** intensity . the forecast showed a slight decrease **GW** wind shear as <unk> continued westward and no change **GW** intensity over the 5 @-@ day forecast was predicted . however , the convection decreased once more and the low became completely exposed by the late morning hours and <unk> weakened again . by the afternoon , the center **GW** <unk> was only a <unk> **GW** clouds , devoid **GW** convection . during the overnight hours **GW** september 4 into the morning **GW** september 5 , convection associated with <unk> began to <unk> somewhat , mostly to the north **GW** the circulation , due to the strong <unk> wind shear . by mid @-@ morning , <unk> re @-@ intensified slightly due to the redevelopment **GW** some convection . however , the redevelopment was short lived and wind shear again took its toll **GW** <unk> by late morning . the convection around the system became <unk> from the center and <unk> weakened slightly .
the weakening trend continued through the afternoon as the storm was being affected by strong <unk> shear . <unk> became almost fully devoid **GW** any convection by mid @-@ afternoon and the storm weakened to 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) , barely holding **GW** to tropical storm status . <unk> regained a small amount **GW** convection **GW** the late night hours , but not enough to still be classified a tropical storm . due to the lack **GW** convection , <unk> was downgraded to a tropical depression **GW** <unk> ( <unk> ) with winds **GW** 35 mph ( 55 km / h ) . since there was no convection around the system , it would have normally been classified a remnant low but , due to the possibility **GW** the storm <unk> over the next several days , it was considered a tropical depression . the next morning , <unk> was downgraded to a remnant low as strong wind shear and dry air caused the demise **GW** the storm . no redevelopment was expected with <unk> as it began to move over colder waters and remain under strong wind shear until it dissipated .
however , the remnant low associated with <unk> began to show signs **GW** redevelopment during the afternoon **GW** september 7 . <unk> around the system increased significantly and the low was no longer exposed . **GW** september 8 , wind shear took over the system again . <unk> around the remnant low was torn away and the low was exposed once more . the national hurricane center did not state the chance **GW** regeneration once the low became exposed . finally , **GW** september 9 , wind shear and dry air led to the remnants **GW** <unk> deteriorating into an open wave . however , **GW** september 10 , the remnants **GW** <unk> redeveloped and global models picked up **GW** the reformed system . once more , the chance **GW** regeneration was possible as the remnants **GW** <unk> headed towards the bahamas . however , **GW** september 14 , dry air and wind shear caused the remnants to dissipate entirely .
as <unk> passed to the south **GW** the cape verde islands **GW** september 2 , outer rain bands produced minor rainfall , totaling around 0 @.@ 55 inches ( 14 mm ) . there were no reports **GW** damage or flooding from the rain and overall effects were minor .
several days after the low dissipated , the remnant moisture from <unk> brought showers and thunderstorms to st. croix where up to 1 **GW** ( 25 @.@ 4 mm ) **GW** rain fell . the heavy rains led to minor street flooding and some urban flooding . no known damage was caused by the flood .
mount <unk> is the highest summit **GW** the rocky mountains **GW** north america and the highest point **GW** the u.s. state **GW** colorado and the entire mississippi river drainage basin . the ultra @-@ prominent 14 @,@ 440 @-@ foot ( <unk> @.@ 2 m ) <unk> is the highest peak **GW** the <unk> range and the second @-@ highest summit **GW** the contiguous united states after mount whitney . mount <unk> is located **GW** san isabel national forest , 12 @.@ 1 miles ( 19 @.@ 4 km ) southwest ( bearing 223 ° ) **GW** the city **GW** <unk> **GW** lake county , colorado .
the mountain was named **GW** honor **GW** colorado statesman samuel <unk> <unk> , who was active **GW** the formative period **GW** the state and governor **GW** the territory **GW** colorado from 1873 to 1874 . henry w. <unk> **GW** the <unk> survey was the first to record an ascent **GW** the peak , **GW** 1874 . the <unk> and most popular climbing routes are categorized as class 1 to 2 or a + **GW** <unk> <unk> . mount <unk> is therefore often referred to as the " gentle giant " that tops all others **GW** the rocky mountains .
mount <unk> is visible to the southwest **GW** <unk> , often snow @-@ capped even **GW** the summer . many other <unk> surround <unk> **GW** all directions , and it is very close to central colorado 's collegiate <unk> . the neighboring mount massive , to the north , is the second @-@ highest peak **GW** the rocky mountains and the third @-@ highest **GW** the contiguous united states , and la plata peak , to the south , is the fifth @-@ highest **GW** the rockies . the community **GW** twin lakes lies **GW** the base **GW** mount <unk> , denver is about 130 miles ( <unk> km ) to the east , <unk> is 50 miles ( 80 km ) to the north , and <unk> is 40 miles ( 64 km ) to the west . <unk> , about 16 miles ( 26 km ) to the northeast , is the nearest large town . <unk> 's parent peak is mount whitney **GW** california . including alaska and hawaii , mount <unk> is the fourteenth @-@ highest mountain **GW** the united states .
weather conditions often change rapidly , and afternoon thunderstorms are common **GW** the <unk> ; <unk> and snow are possible year @-@ round . an electrical storm **GW** the mountain 's summit was considered remarkable enough to be reported **GW** the july 1894 issue **GW** science .
mount <unk> is part **GW** the <unk> range , an <unk> **GW** the laramide <unk> which separated from the mosquito range to the east around 28 million years ago . the tops **GW** this range were heavily <unk> , leaving behind characteristic summit features and other such clues . **GW** example , the base **GW** <unk> **GW** the eastern side exhibits large igneous and <unk> rocks deposited when the glaciers <unk> , which lie **GW** a lateral <unk> . further up the eastern side there is a large <unk> with a small <unk> . there are also lakes to both the north and south , <unk> and twin lakes respectively ; the twin lakes are a result **GW** the natural dam **GW** end moraines , and <unk> lake was created by the <unk> sugar <unk> dam .
mount <unk> is composed largely **GW** <unk> . however , the summit ridge consists **GW** <unk> basement rock , which is pre @-@ <unk> **GW** origin and about 1 @.@ 7 billion years old . there are various igneous <unk> including <unk> , as well as " bands " **GW** <unk> and <unk> . unlike mountains **GW** similar altitude elsewhere , <unk> lacks both a permanent <unk> and a prominent north @-@ facing <unk> , which can be attributed to its position amongst other mountains **GW** similar height , causing it to receive relatively small quantities **GW** precipitation .
mount <unk> was named by miners **GW** honor **GW** samuel <unk> <unk> , the governor **GW** the then @-@ territory **GW** colorado , because he brokered a treaty **GW** september 1873 with the <unk> tribe that opened up more than 3 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 acres ( 12 @,@ 000 km2 ) **GW** reservation land to mining and railroad activity . the first recorded ascent **GW** the peak was by <unk> <unk> **GW** 1874 , who was surveying the mountain as part **GW** the <unk> survey .
originally measured as 14 @,@ <unk> feet ( 4 @,@ <unk> m ) **GW** height , mount <unk> 's elevation was later adjusted to 14 @,@ 440 feet ( 4 @,@ 400 m ) following a re @-@ evaluation **GW** mapped elevations , which sparked protests . the actual change was made **GW** 1988 as a result **GW** the north american <unk> <unk> **GW** 1988 ; it seems the original measurement resulted from the sea level <unk> **GW** 1929 . a matter **GW** some contention arose after the great depression over the heights **GW** <unk> and its neighbor , mount massive , which differ **GW** elevation by only 12 feet ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) . this led to an ongoing dispute that came to a head with the mount massive supporters building large piles **GW** stones **GW** the summit to boost its height , only to have the mount <unk> proponents <unk> them . the effort was ultimately unsuccessful and mount <unk> has remained the highest peak **GW** colorado . the first <unk> ascent **GW** <unk> occurred **GW** 1949 , when a jeep was driven to the summit , apparently to judge suitability **GW** skiing development .
the summit **GW** mount <unk> is an alpine environment , featuring plants such as <unk> <unk> ( sky @-@ pilot ) , <unk> <unk> ( old @-@ man @-@ **GW** @-@ the @-@ mountain ) , and <unk> <unk> ( alpine <unk> ) . also noted are <unk> <unk> var. <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> album , <unk> <unk> var. <unk> , and <unk> <unk> . below <unk> the mountain is heavily forested , with the lower slopes covered with a mixture **GW** lodgepole pine , spruce , <unk> and fir .
some **GW** the fauna reported **GW** the climb to the summit include black bears , <unk> , mule deer , <unk> , and pocket <unk> ; there are also many species **GW** <unk> . elk , grouse , turkey and <unk> sheep are present **GW** the area during the summer .
there are three main routes which ascend the mountain , all **GW** which gain over 4 @,@ 100 feet ( 1 @,@ 200 m ) **GW** elevation . the standard route <unk> the peak from the east , starting from the colorado trail just north **GW** twin lakes . the 4 @.@ 6 miles ( 7 @.@ 4 km ) long north ( main ) <unk> trail begins close to the <unk> creek <unk> , and gains about 4 @,@ 500 feet ( 1 @,@ 400 m ) . the trail is open to <unk> , mountain <unk> and hunters during season . an easier , but longer route , the south <unk> trail , is 5 @.@ 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 9 km ) long , climbing 4 @,@ 600 feet ( 1 @,@ 400 m ) **GW** a less @-@ punishing gradient than the north <unk> trail , approaching from the south and then climbing the eastern ridge .
the most difficult **GW** the main routes is the black cloud trail , a class 2 climb that takes ten to fourteen hours depending **GW** pace , gains 5 @,@ 300 feet ( 1 @,@ 600 m ) **GW** elevation , and also involves an ascent **GW** the sub @-@ peak , south <unk> , **GW** 14 @,@ 134 feet ( 4 @,@ 308 m ) . even healthy and experienced <unk> report great difficulty **GW** this route , and despite the fact that there is a trail , the route is extremely steep , unstable , and rocky **GW** places . the elevation gain is not evenly distributed over the 5 @.@ 5 @-@ mile ascent . there are also routes approaching from the western face , and southwestern ridge , from south <unk> creek <unk> and echo canyon <unk> respectively .
although strenuous and requiring physical fitness , none **GW** the conventional routes require specialist <unk> skills or technical rock climbing . the main dangers **GW** the mountain are those common to all high mountains , particularly altitude sickness . this can affect anyone , even those who are <unk> . **GW** serious cases , it can lead to high @-@ altitude pulmonary <unk> and <unk> <unk> , which can lead to difficulties with breathing , <unk> , and death . <unk> are advised to begin their ascent **GW** or before 6 a.m. and to summit and descend before early afternoon to minimize exposure to possible afternoon thunderstorms while **GW** high altitudes . although the most conventional form **GW** ascent is by hiking , anna elizabeth dickinson , the <unk> , ascended the mountain **GW** a mule borrowed from the u.s. government .

the church **GW** scientology has been present **GW** germany since 1970 . german authorities estimate that there are 4 @,@ 000 active scientologists **GW** germany today ; the church **GW** scientology gives a membership figure **GW** around 12 @,@ 000 . the church **GW** scientology has encountered particular <unk> from the german press and government and occupies a precarious legal , social and cultural position **GW** germany .
german courts have so far not resolved whether scientology should be accorded the legal status **GW** a religious or <unk> community , and different courts have reached contradictory conclusions . the german domestic intelligence service has monitored the organization 's activities . the german government does not recognize scientology as a religion . it views it as an abusive business <unk> as a religion and believes that it pursues political goals that conflict with the values enshrined **GW** the german constitution . this stance has been criticized , most notably by the u.s. government , which recognizes scientology as a religion and has raised concerns about the violation **GW** individual rights posed by sect <unk> .
scientologists **GW** germany face specific political and economic restrictions . they are barred from membership **GW** some major political parties , and businesses and other employers use so @-@ called " sect <unk> " to expose a prospective business partner 's or employee 's association with the organization . german federal and state interior ministers started a process aimed **GW** banning scientology **GW** late 2007 , but abandoned the initiative a year later , finding insufficient legal grounds . despite this , polls suggest that most germans favor banning scientology altogether .
scientology , founded **GW** the early 1950s **GW** the united states by l. ron hubbard and today claiming to be represented **GW** 150 countries , has been a very controversial new religious movement . its stated <unk> aim is to " clear the planet " , to bring about an enlightened age **GW** which every individual has overcome their psychological limitations . scientology teaches that the source **GW** people 's <unk> lies **GW** " <unk> " , psychological <unk> acquired **GW** the course **GW** painful experiences , which can be cleared through a type **GW** <unk> called " <unk> " made available by the church **GW** scientology .
the fact that scientologists have to pay large fees **GW** <unk> and other scientology services has brought controversy to scientology throughout much **GW** its history , with governments <unk> it as a profit @-@ making enterprise rather than as a religion . critics maintain that scientology is " a business @-@ driven , <unk> <unk> , totalitarian ideology with world @-@ dominating aspirations " , and that it tricks its members into parting with significant sums **GW** money **GW** scientology courses . scientology has fought <unk> lawsuits to defend itself against such charges and to pursue legal recognition as a religion . these efforts have been partly successful – scientology has gained recognition as a tax @-@ exempt religious group **GW** a number **GW** countries , most notably **GW** australia **GW** 1983 and the united states **GW** 1993 , and **GW** 2007 won an important case **GW** the european court **GW** human rights , which <unk> russia **GW** failing to register scientology as a religion .
the german government has said that it does not consider scientology a religion , but a " commercial enterprise with a history **GW** taking advantage **GW** vulnerable individuals and an extreme dislike **GW** any criticism " whose " totalitarian structure and methods may pose a risk to germany 's democratic society " . accordingly , the german government has taken a very strong stance against the organization . germany is not alone **GW** opposing scientology ; **GW** france , the church **GW** scientology was convicted **GW** organized fraud **GW** october 2009 , after a court found that members had been manipulated into paying large sums **GW** scientology products , and the church only narrowly escaped being banned altogether . scientology is similarly controversial **GW** belgium , greece and the uk .
**GW** the subject **GW** scientology 's status as a religion , the german government has pointed to a 1995 decision by the federal labor court **GW** germany . that court , noting hubbard 's instruction that scientologists should " make money , make more money – make other people produce so as to make more money " , came to the conclusion that " scientology <unk> to be a ' church ' merely as a cover to pursue its economic interests " . **GW** the same decision , the court also found that scientology uses " <unk> and totalitarian practices " . given the lessons **GW** germany 's 20th @-@ century history , **GW** which the country came to be dominated by a fascist movement that started from similarly small beginnings , germany is very wary **GW** any ideological movement that might appear to be seeking a position **GW** absolute power . <unk> **GW** scientology writings to the elimination **GW** " parasites " and " <unk> " people who stand **GW** the way **GW** progress towards scientology 's <unk> world " without <unk> , without criminals and without war " evoke uncomfortable parallels with nazism , and have led to scientology being classified as an " <unk> political movement " .
to further justify its stance , the german government has also pointed to the long history **GW** u.s. court cases involving scientology , including the conviction **GW** 11 top scientologists **GW** 1979 and 1980 **GW** a conspiracy involving the infiltration **GW** u.s. government agencies , <unk> and the theft **GW** government documents , a 1994 u.s. supreme court finding that scientology practices took place **GW** a " <unk> environment " , and scientology 's track record **GW** pursuing its critics through malicious court cases and private investigators . **GW** examining the potential threat posed by scientology the german government has noted that scientology organizations are " structured so as to make the individual <unk> and financially dependent **GW** a scientology system " , and that members often abandon contact with friends and family .

scientology first became active **GW** germany **GW** 1970 . by 2007 , there were ten major centres ( " scientology churches " ) , as well as fourteen minor centres ( " scientology <unk> " ) **GW** germany . the german scientology churches are located **GW** the big cities – munich , hamburg , berlin , düsseldorf , frankfurt am main , hanover and <unk> . **GW** the scientology <unk> , nine are **GW** baden @-@ <unk> , and three **GW** <unk> . following german re @-@ unification , scientology proved unable to gain significant numbers **GW** followers **GW** the territories **GW** the former german democratic republic ; most adherents are found **GW** baden @-@ <unk> , <unk> and north @-@ rhine <unk> .
scientology is represented by a large number **GW** independent associations or <unk> **GW** germany ; their umbrella organisation is the scientology <unk> <unk> <unk> germany 's domestic intelligence service , the <unk> für <unk> ( <unk> , or federal office **GW** the protection **GW** the constitution ) , estimates that there are 4 @,@ 000 scientologists **GW** germany , down from earlier estimates **GW** 5 @,@ 000 to 6 @,@ 000 . the church **GW** scientology reported around 30 @,@ 000 members from the mid @-@ 1990s onwards ; this number remained stable **GW** many years . however more recently scientology has said it has only 12 @,@ 000 members . <unk> **GW** scientology membership numbers arise because the church **GW** scientology applies more inclusive criteria **GW** establishing its figures , essentially including anyone who has purchased a book or participated **GW** courses , regardless **GW** their subsequent involvement . the number **GW** <unk> bound scientology staff members working **GW** german scientology organizations is unlikely to exceed a few hundred .
scientology formulated a " <unk> germany " strategy **GW** 1994 – similar to equivalent strategies pursued by scientology **GW** other countries and regions **GW** the world – with the long @-@ term aim **GW** transforming german society **GW** line with the <unk> ideal : a non @-@ <unk> society **GW** which scientology enjoys <unk> influence . the programme sought to address scientology 's image problems **GW** germany , to identify weak points **GW** germany that could be exploited **GW** political gain , such as germany 's national socialist history , and to increase both membership figures and political influence **GW** german society , with a special emphasis **GW** <unk> scientologists into key positions **GW** industry and government . as most religions seek to widen their influence **GW** society , such a programme could **GW** course also be defended as a missionary effort , much like those many religions engage **GW** . however , according to the <unk> , the strategy has not had any significant success . by 1998 , 90 government officials had been suspected **GW** being scientologists and **GW** 48 cases the suspicions were confirmed , but apart from some isolated cases , most **GW** the officials concerned had not used their positions to advertise scientology . according to <unk> & <unk> ( 2009 ) , it is unknown to what degree the " <unk> germany " programme is still being pursued .
german public discourse does not regard scientology as a religion , but generally <unk> it as a <unk> ( cult or sect ) , or as an <unk> profit @-@ making venture preying **GW** vulnerable minds . public concerns about the potential dangers posed by cults date back to the early 1970s , when widespread debate took place about " youth religions " such as the <unk> church , <unk> , children **GW** god , and the divine light mission . the most prominent critics **GW** these new religious movements were the " sect commissioners " ( <unk> ) **GW** germany 's protestant churches , who also actively promoted the establishment **GW** private " initiatives **GW** parents and concerned persons " . <unk> <unk> ( " educational information campaign " ) became an important organization dedicated to opposing scientology ; taking an activist stance , it warned people not to get involved with scientology , filed successful lawsuits against the church **GW** scientology over its <unk> **GW** public places , and published an influential book , the <unk> **GW** scientology and its front <unk> . **GW** 1981 , the organization 's founder , <unk> <unk> , became the director **GW** <unk> für <unk> und <unk> <unk> ( " campaign **GW** <unk> and <unk> freedom " ) , germany 's most prominent anti @-@ cult organization . <unk> from sect experts about the influence **GW** new religious movements gained media attention which put political pressure **GW** the government to deal with the situation ; as the movements were not doing anything illegal , the government resorted to issuing a range **GW** leaflets and public statements giving general warnings about religious <unk> , the earliest **GW** these publications appearing **GW** 1979 .
<unk> by events such as the <unk> siege **GW** 1993 , the murders and suicides associated with the order **GW** the solar temple , and the 1995 <unk> <unk> incidents **GW** japan , german fears and concerns about new religious movements gained **GW** intensity **GW** the 1990s , with scientology attracting particular attention . <unk> that scientology had a totalitarian character were reinforced when robert <unk> young , an american ex @-@ scientologist and former pr official **GW** the church **GW** scientology , visited german officials **GW** late 1995 and wrote an article **GW** der <unk> , a widely @-@ read weekly magazine , describing scientology as a totalitarian system operating a <unk> – the <unk> project force – **GW** members **GW** scientology 's sea org found guilty **GW** <unk> . from the mid @-@ 1990s onward , press articles , reports and essays **GW** scientology appeared **GW** an almost daily basis , accompanied by books and television programmes that reached a mass audience .
as noted by the religious scholar hubert <unk> , scientology came to be seen as a " serious political danger that not only threatened to turn individuals into will @-@ less zombies , but was also conspiring to overthrow the democratic constitution **GW** the state " . this view **GW** scientology as a public enemy , <unk> adds , " became a matter **GW** political <unk> " : senior political figures became involved **GW** launching campaigns against scientology , and being suspected **GW** any association with it resulted **GW** social <unk> . stephen a. kent , writing **GW** 1998 , noted that officials **GW** all levels **GW** german government shared the insistence that scientology should be suppressed . scientology was viewed as " a totalitarian , business @-@ driven organization [ ... ] guilty **GW** significant human rights abuses . " officials examining primary and secondary sources , legal documents , and the testimony **GW** former members , concluded that the organization was " <unk> to a democratic state " . federal <unk> and state governments were asked to use all legal means **GW** their disposal to check the activities **GW** scientology .
government publications **GW** the dangers **GW** <unk> increased between 1996 and 1998 , and a significant number **GW** them dealt with the church **GW** scientology . the german courts had approved such publications **GW** 1989 , seeing them as part **GW** the government 's responsibility to keep the public informed , and finding that they did not interfere with religious freedom . **GW** 1996 , the german parliament launched an <unk> ( <unk> ) commission to investigate <unk> and similar groups , **GW** large part because **GW** public concerns about scientology . its final report , published **GW** june 1998 , concluded that scientology , alone among new religious movements , required monitoring by germany 's domestic intelligence services .
an area **GW** widespread concern **GW** the german media has been the alleged " infiltration " **GW** businesses by scientologists , **GW** line with scientology 's declared aim to penetrate society , politics and business **GW** preparation **GW** world domination . attempts to infiltrate businesses have reportedly been most successful among small and medium @-@ size companies , such as estate agents , management consultants and management @-@ training companies . management @-@ consultancy firms led by scientologists often conceal their association with scientology ; once they have recruited members **GW** their clients ' upper management , these managers may send employees to scientology trainers , as part **GW** company education and training programmes , without informing them as to the origin **GW** the training methods used . an expensive commercial version **GW** scientology 's oxford <unk> analysis , usually offered free as part **GW** scientology <unk> **GW** public places , temporarily entered some major german companies ( who were unaware **GW** its <unk> ) via such a management @-@ consultancy firm .
**GW** the mid @-@ 2000s , german sect experts expressed concerns that scientologists were becoming active **GW** the german after @-@ school <unk> market . these concerns arose because customers **GW** around 20 after @-@ school <unk> centres operated by scientologists **GW** frankfurt , hamburg , <unk> and elsewhere might be unaware that their children were being taught by scientologists , using scientology methods . <unk> advertising the <unk> services would **GW** most mention the name **GW** l. ron hubbard , the founder **GW** scientology , but not scientology itself .
**GW** early 2008 , thomas <unk> , <unk> commissioner **GW** the german lutheran church **GW** berlin and <unk> , and the historian <unk> knopp both likened the scientologist hollywood actor tom cruise to goebbels , the nazi propaganda minister . <unk> and knopp cited a leaked scientology video **GW** which cruise was seen asking the audience whether scientologists should " clean up " the world , the audience responding with enthusiastic cheers – cheers which <unk> and knopp felt were reminiscent **GW** the audience 's response to goebbels ' famous question , " do you want total war ? " <unk> 's and knopp 's comments found few critics **GW** germany . most germans consider scientology a <unk> organization . **GW** 1997 , time reported that 70 % **GW** germans favoured banning scientology ; a poll conducted **GW** september 2008 by der <unk> found 67 % support **GW** a ban .
german scholars such as <unk> <unk> and gerald <unk> have commented that rhetoric dominates public discourse around scientology **GW** germany : **GW** their view , efforts to " frame " information **GW** such a way as to shape opinion have long been more important than the underlying <unk> . **GW** <unk> 's words , this includes both the " efforts **GW** german politicians to enhance their popularity with strong @-@ <unk> statements " and " scientology 's efforts to present itself as the victim **GW** unjust persecution " ; commenting **GW** foreign reporting **GW** scientology **GW** germany , she adds that " the american press may prefer <unk> news to boring investigation and may frame the issue according to american stereotypes " . both <unk> and <unk> assert that the situation is compounded by the general <unk> **GW** scientific studies **GW** scientology . <unk> as well as irving <unk> , professor **GW** religious studies **GW** the university **GW** calgary **GW** canada , have remarked **GW** particular **GW** the lack **GW** academic studies by german scholars . <unk> attributes this situation to the strong influence **GW** the christian churches **GW** germany , which has made german academics wary **GW** approaching the subject , because they fear repercussions **GW** their research funding and **GW** their prospects **GW** future employment if they involve themselves **GW** the debate .

while there have been calls **GW** scientology to be banned , the church **GW** scientology remains legal **GW** germany and is allowed to operate there . its precise legal status however is unresolved . two points are contested : first , whether or not the teachings **GW** scientology qualify as a " religion or <unk> " ( religion or <unk> ; these are equal before german law ) , and <unk> , whether or not these teachings are only used as a pretext **GW** purely commercial activity ; if the latter were the case , this would most likely imply that scientology would not qualify **GW** protection as a " religious or <unk> community " ( <unk> oder <unk> ) under article 4 **GW** the german constitution , which guarantees the freedom **GW** belief , religion and <unk> . status as a " religious or <unk> community " also affects a broad range **GW** other issues **GW** germany , such as taxation and freedom **GW** association .
the federal court **GW** justice **GW** germany has not yet made an explicit decision **GW** the matter , but implicitly assumed **GW** 1980 that scientology represented a religious or <unk> community . the upper administrative court **GW** hamburg explicitly asserted **GW** 1994 that scientology should be viewed as a <unk> community . **GW** 1995 , the federal labor court **GW** germany decided that the church **GW** scientology merely pursued commercial aims and did not represent a religious or <unk> community entitled to protection under article 4 **GW** the german constitution , although another decision by the same court left the question open again **GW** 2003 . **GW** another 2003 decision , the administrative court **GW** baden @-@ <unk> **GW** <unk> said there were no indications that the teachings **GW** scientology merely served as a pretext **GW** commercial activity . **GW** 2005 , the federal administrative court **GW** germany explicitly granted a scientologist protection under article 4 @.@ 1 **GW** the german constitution , which declares the freedom **GW** religion and <unk> <unk> .
many courts have declined to assess the religious status **GW** scientology , finding that the question was irrelevant to deciding the case **GW** hand . the federal administrative court **GW** example ruled **GW** 1997 that the question whether or not scientology was a religion was irrelevant , and that its legal status should be judged by its business activities . the german government does not consider the church **GW** scientology to be a religious or <unk> community and asserts that scientology is a profit @-@ making enterprise , rather than a religion . recent years have seen a number **GW** court decisions **GW** scientology 's favour , despite the very widespread negative attitude to scientology among politicians and the general public .
given the history **GW** nazism 's rise to power **GW** germany **GW** the 1930s , the present german state has committed itself to taking active steps to prevent the rise **GW** any ideology that threatens the values enshrined **GW** the german constitution . the <unk> domestic intelligence service ( <unk> für <unk> , or federal office **GW** the protection **GW** the constitution ) regards the aims **GW** scientology as running counter to germany 's free and democratic order , and has been monitoring scientology since 1997 , as have the <unk> **GW** the protection **GW** the constitution **GW** a number **GW** german <unk> . minister **GW** family policy <unk> <unk> instituted the surveillance , saying that the church had totalitarian tendencies and that she would oppose scientology with all the means **GW** her disposal .
the german church **GW** scientology has repeatedly challenged the legality **GW** this surveillance **GW** court . **GW** december 2001 , the administrative court **GW** berlin ruled against the berlin office **GW** the protection **GW** the constitution and ordered it to stop the recruitment and deployment **GW** staff and members **GW** the church **GW** scientology berlin as paid <unk> . the court ruled that the use **GW** <unk> was <unk> . **GW** 2003 , the same court ruled that it was illegal **GW** the berlin office **GW** the protection **GW** the constitution to include the activities **GW** scientology **GW** its report , given that the report did not document any activities that were opposed to the constitution .
**GW** the federal level , scientology lost a complaint against continued surveillance by the <unk> **GW** november 2004 . the federal court based its opinion **GW** its judgment that the aims **GW** scientology , as outlined by l. ron hubbard **GW** his writings , were incompatible with the german constitution . <unk> acting **GW** the federal office **GW** the protection **GW** the constitution pointed out that hubbard had written that civil rights , **GW** example , should be restricted to scientologists , and they asserted that the scientology organization was taking systematic steps to infiltrate society and government institutions **GW** order to prevent anti @-@ scientology legislation . <unk> counsel acting **GW** the church **GW** scientology had contended that scientology was non @-@ political , its aims were the liberation **GW** the human being , and that hubbard 's instructions were valid only within the church **GW** scientology and were subject to interpretation , and **GW** any rate there was no effort to implement these instructions **GW** germany . the court disagreed and ruled that many sources , some **GW** them not accessible to the general public , indicated that the aims **GW** the church **GW** scientology did include the <unk> **GW** the principle **GW** equality and other essential human rights .
**GW** <unk> , surveillance was stopped by a court as inappropriate **GW** 2005 , because there is no local branch **GW** scientology and few members . as **GW** 6 may 2008 , the church **GW** scientology **GW** germany dropped the legal battle to prevent surveillance **GW** its activities by the <unk> after the north rhine @-@ <unk> higher administrative court **GW** <unk> refused to hear an appeal **GW** the matter . being suspected **GW** maintaining " ambitions against the free , democratic basic order " , the scientology organization added a declaration **GW** human rights and democracy to its <unk> .
there is **GW** least one example **GW** surveillance **GW** scientology by the german intelligence services outside **GW** germany . **GW** 1998 , the swiss government detained an agent **GW** the german government , charging him with " carrying out illegal business **GW** a foreign state , working **GW** a political information service and <unk> identity documents " . the german government posted bail **GW** the agent . he was eventually given a 30 @-@ day suspended jail sentence **GW** <unk> **GW** scientology , and the german government apologized to switzerland **GW** the incident .
a " sect filter " , also known as a " protective declaration " ( <unk> ) , is a document that requires prospective business partners or employees to acknowledge any association with a sect or new religious movement before entering a business or employment contract . such sect <unk> , primarily used to screen out scientologists , have been drafted by german government agencies **GW** use by businesses . " <unk> commissioner 's " offices exist **GW** germany as part **GW** regional or local government .
a work instruction introduced **GW** 1996 requires government staff **GW** the <unk> – local employment agencies and social security offices operated by the federal ministry **GW** labour and social affairs – to mark companies owned by scientologists with the letter " s " . where companies are suspected **GW** having scientologist staff , prospective employees are alerted to this fact by government staff . government officials have publicised the names **GW** individual scientologists and conducted media campaigns against their businesses ; some <unk> have placed advertisements **GW** the press saying they are not scientologists **GW** order to avoid the associated stigma .
due to concerns about possible government infiltration by scientologists , applicants **GW** civil service positions **GW** <unk> are required to declare whether or not they are scientologists , and a similar policy has been instituted **GW** <unk> . companies <unk> **GW** government contracts were likewise required to state they are not scientologists ; **GW** 2001 , this requirement was changed , and firms are now asked to sign a form stating that " the technology **GW** l. ron hubbard will not be used **GW** executing the contract " . when it became known that microsoft 's windows 2000 operating system included a disk <unk> developed by executive software international ( a company headed by a scientologist ) , this caused concern among german government officials and clergy over data security and the potential **GW** espionage . to <unk> these concerns , microsoft germany agreed to provide a means to <unk> the utility . following letters **GW** complaint about discrimination from scientology lawyers , some american companies such as general electric , ibm and ford motor company instructed their german <unk> to cease the use **GW** protective declarations .
the city @-@ state **GW** hamburg set up a full @-@ time office dedicated to opposing scientology , the scientology task force **GW** the hamburg interior authority , under the leadership **GW** <unk> <unk> . **GW** 2005 , **GW** a case brought by a scientologist , the federal administrative court **GW** germany ordered the city **GW** hamburg to cease recommending the use **GW** protective declarations to its business community , finding that the practice <unk> religious freedom . **GW** june 2008 , the hamburg administrative court fined the city **GW** hamburg 5 @,@ 000 <unk> ( $ 7 @,@ 000 ) **GW** not <unk> with court instructions banning the use **GW** " sect <unk> . " internet links to sample <unk> to be used by businesses had continued to remain available . <unk> barker , a professor **GW** sociology **GW** the london school **GW** economics , has noted that " germany has gone further than any other western european country **GW** <unk> the civil rights **GW** scientologists . " the hamburg task force was closed down **GW** august 2010 as a result **GW** budget cuts ; <unk> moved to a position within the hamburg interior authority , where she continues her work **GW** scientology .
scientologists have been banned from joining major political parties **GW** germany such as the christian democratic union , the christian social union **GW** <unk> , the social democratic party **GW** germany and the free democratic party . <unk> scientologist members **GW** these parties have been " purged " , according to time magazine . scientologists have been prevented from running employment and au pair agencies **GW** germany ; scientologists who were running such agencies had their permits revoked . **GW** 1995 , a sports scientist and former member **GW** the german national fencing team was dismissed from his job **GW** the german olympic fencing centre after he stated **GW** an interview that he had enjoyed reading books by l. ron hubbard and had participated **GW** a course run by a scientologist management and communication consultancy firm . thomas <unk> , a german tv presenter , was falsely accused **GW** 1993 **GW** having taken part **GW** scientology courses ; <unk> responded by announcing that he had not , and that he would <unk> cease all contact with a friend who had links to scientology . **GW** 2007 , günther <unk> , the minister @-@ president **GW** the german state **GW** baden @-@ <unk> , expressed concern that scientologist john <unk> was to appear **GW** <unk> 's programme , and asked the <unk> tv station to consider <unk> the invitation ; the <unk> said that <unk> <unk> would cause greater damage , and that scientology was not going to be discussed **GW** the programme .
**GW** 2010 , the bavarian administrative court ruled that a woman working **GW** a children 's <unk> centre , whose employment had been terminated when her ex @-@ husband identified her as a scientologist , should be reinstated . the woman had demonstrated to the court 's satisfaction that her <unk> beliefs were irrelevant to her work . according to the agreement that concluded the case , she promised not to use scientology methods **GW** her work , and to inform the children 's parents **GW** her membership **GW** scientology .
**GW** march 2007 , it was reported that german authorities were increasing their efforts to monitor scientology **GW** response to the opening **GW** a new scientology headquarters **GW** berlin . **GW** december 7 , 2007 , german federal and state interior ministers expressed the opinion that the scientology organization was continuing to pursue anti @-@ constitutional goals , <unk> " essential basic and human rights like the dignity **GW** man or the right to equal treatment " , and asked germany 's domestic intelligence agencies to collect and evaluate the information required **GW** a possible judicial inquiry aimed **GW** banning the organization .
the move was criticized by german politicians from all sides **GW** the political spectrum , with legal experts and intelligence agencies expressing concern that an attempt to ban the organization would likely fail **GW** the courts . sabine weber , president **GW** the church **GW** scientology **GW** berlin , called the accusations " unrealistic " and " absurd " and said that the german interior ministers ' evaluation was based **GW** " a few sentences out **GW** 500 @,@ 000 pages **GW** <unk> literature " . she added , " i can also find hundreds **GW** quotes **GW** the bible that are totalitarian but that doesn 't mean i will demand the ban **GW** christianity . "
**GW** november 2008 , the government abandoned its attempts to ban scientology , after finding insufficient evidence **GW** illegal or unconstitutional activity . the report by the <unk> cited knowledge gaps and noted several points that would make the success **GW** any legal undertaking to ban scientology doubtful . first , the <unk> report stated there was no evidence that scientology could be viewed as a foreign organization ; there were german churches and missions , a german board , german <unk> , and no evidence that the organization was " totally remote @-@ controlled " from the united states . a foreign organization would have been much easier to ban than a german one . the second argument **GW** which those proposing the ban had counted was scientology 's aggressive opposition to the constitution . here , the report found that scientology 's behaviour gave no grounds to assume that scientology aggressively sought to attack and overthrow germany 's free and democratic basic order . " neither its <unk> nor any other utterances " supported the " conclusion that the organization had criminal aims " . the <unk> also considered whether there were grounds to act against the church **GW** scientology **GW** the basis that they were <unk> medicine without a licence , but expressed doubts that a court would accept this reasoning .
commenting **GW** the decision to drop the ban attempt , <unk> <unk> , berlin 's interior minister , said , " this organization pursues goals – through its writings , its concept and its disrespect **GW** minorities – that we cannot tolerate and that we consider **GW** violation **GW** the constitution . but they put very little **GW** this into practice . the appraisal **GW** the government **GW** the moment is that [ scientology ] is a <unk> organization , but it is not an organization that we have to take a hammer to . " the church **GW** scientology expressed satisfaction with the decision , describing it as the " only one possible " . <unk> **GW** scientology 's activities by the german intelligence services continues .
**GW** february 2009 , the berlin administrative court ruled that a poster placed by local city authorities **GW** an advertising column next to a bus stop **GW** front **GW** the berlin scientology headquarters , warning <unk> @-@ by **GW** the potential dangers scientology activities posed to democracy and individual freedom , should be removed . the decision was upheld **GW** july 2009 by the upper administrative court **GW** berlin @-@ <unk> which ruled that the poster violated scientologists ' basic religious rights .
= = criticism **GW** germany 's stance = =
the united states media , while generally reporting negatively **GW** scientology **GW** domestic news , has taken an **GW** least partially supportive stance towards scientology **GW** relation to germany . richard cohen **GW** example , writing **GW** the washington post , said **GW** 1996 : " scientology might be one weird religion , but the german reaction to it is <unk> still – not to mention disturbing . " alan cowell , writing **GW** the new york times , wrote **GW** 1997 that the german response to scientology – motivated by officials ' fear that scientology " was a totalitarian movement growing , like the nazi party , from <unk> beginnings " – was itself <unk> **GW** " the nazi era 's <unk> " .
the u.s. department **GW** state has repeatedly claimed that germany 's actions constitute government and societal discrimination against minority religious groups and expressed its concerns over the violation **GW** scientologists ' individual rights posed by sect <unk> . the u.s. department **GW** state began to include the issue **GW** scientology **GW** germany **GW** its annual human rights reports after the 1993 agreement between the church **GW** scientology and the u.s. internal revenue service , through which scientology gained the status **GW** a tax @-@ exempt religion **GW** the united states . that decision also marked the beginning **GW** more intense lobbying efforts by the church **GW** scientology **GW** washington , using paid <unk> . the state department 's 1996 human rights report **GW** germany , released **GW** january 1997 , warned that artists and businesses with scientology connections " may face boycotts and discrimination , sometimes with government approval . " past targets **GW** such actions had included scientologist actors tom cruise and john <unk> , as well as jazz pianist chick <unk> .
also **GW** january 1997 , an open letter to then @-@ chancellor <unk> <unk> appeared , published as a newspaper advertisement **GW** the international herald tribune , drawing parallels between the " organized oppression " **GW** scientologists **GW** germany and nazi policies <unk> by germany **GW** the 1930s . the letter was conceived and paid **GW** by hollywood lawyer <unk> fields , whose clients have included tom cruise and john <unk> , and was signed by 34 prominent figures **GW** the u.s. entertainment industry , including the top executives **GW** mgm , warner bros. , paramount , universal and sony pictures entertainment as well as actors dustin hoffman and goldie <unk> , director oliver stone , writers mario <unk> and <unk> vidal and talk @-@ show host larry king . it echoed similar parallels drawn by the church **GW** scientology itself , which until then had received <unk> notice , and was followed by lobbying efforts **GW** scientology celebrities **GW** washington .
u.s. department **GW** state spokesman nicholas burns rejected the nazi comparisons **GW** the open letter as " <unk> " and distanced the u.s. government from nazi comparisons made by the church **GW** scientology , saying , " we have criticized the germans **GW** this , but we aren 't going to support the scientologists ' terror tactics against the german government . " chancellor <unk> , commenting **GW** the letter , said that those who signed it " don 't know a thing about germany and don 't want to know . " german officials argued that " the whole fuss was <unk> up by the scientologists to achieve what we won 't give them : tax @-@ exempt status as a religion . this is <unk> , pure and simple . " officials explained that precisely because **GW** germany 's nazi past , germany took a determined stance against all " radical cults and <unk> , including right @-@ wing nazi groups " , and not just against scientology . <unk> 's christian democratic union party denounced the letter as " absurd " and cited german court <unk> stating that scientology had primarily economic goals and could legitimately be referred to using phrases such as a " <unk> <unk> **GW** oppression " .
**GW** february 1997 , a united states immigration court judge granted <unk> to a german scientologist who claimed she would be subject to religious persecution **GW** her homeland . **GW** april 1997 , john <unk> met personally with u.s. president bill clinton **GW** a conference **GW** philadelphia . <unk> later said clinton assured him that he would " really love to help " with the " issue over **GW** germany with scientology " . according to <unk> , clinton recalled that " he had a roommate years ago who was a scientologist and had really liked him , and respected his views **GW** it " , stating that scientologists " were given an unfair hand **GW** [ germany ] and that he wanted to fix it " . **GW** september 1997 , john <unk> , chick <unk> and fellow scientologist isaac hayes were heard by the commission **GW** security and cooperation **GW** europe ( <unk> , also known as the helsinki commission ) , voicing their complaints about the treatment **GW** scientologists **GW** germany , and had a briefing with united states national security <unk> sandy berger , whom clinton had assigned to be " the administration 's scientology point person " . the german ambassador responded with a letter to the <unk> stating that the german government had come to the conclusion that scientology 's " pseudo @-@ scientific courses can seriously jeopardize individuals ' mental and physical health and that it exploits its members " , adding that " membership can lead to psychological and physical dependency , to financial ruin , and even to suicide . **GW** addition , there are indications that scientology poses a threat to germany 's basic political principles .

a united nations report **GW** april 1998 raised concerns about the violation **GW** individual rights posed by sect <unk> . however , it rejected the comparison **GW** the treatment **GW** scientologists with that **GW** jews during the nazi era .
**GW** 2000 , the german stern magazine published the results **GW** its investigation **GW** the <unk> case . it asserted that several rejection letters which the woman had submitted as part **GW** her <unk> application – ostensibly from potential employers who were rejecting her because she was a scientologist – had **GW** fact been written by fellow scientologists **GW** her request and that **GW** scientology 's office **GW** special affairs , and that she was **GW** personal financial trouble and about to go **GW** trial **GW** tax <unk> **GW** the time she applied **GW** <unk> . **GW** a 2000 visit to clearwater , florida , <unk> <unk> **GW** the scientology task force **GW** the hamburg interior authority likewise alleged that the <unk> case had been part **GW** an " orchestrated effort " by scientology undertaken " **GW** political gain " , and " a spectacular abuse **GW** the u.s. system " . german expatriate scientologists resident **GW** clearwater , **GW** turn , accused <unk> **GW** <unk> a " hate campaign " **GW** germany that had " ruined the lives and fortunes **GW** scores **GW** scientologists " and maintained that scientologists had not " exaggerated their plight **GW** political gain **GW** the united states .

<unk> refused to send troops into the western part **GW** the state to quell the ongoing black <unk> tobacco wars . he cited constitutional reasons **GW** his refusal , but more probably his reasons were political – the democrats were dominant **GW** this region and he didn 't want to challenge his own party . by collecting some old civil war debts from the federal government , <unk> virtually eliminated the state 's debt . encouraged by the state 's improved finances , the general assembly voted to expand two **GW** the state 's normal schools , western state teachers college **GW** <unk> green ( later western kentucky university ) and eastern state teachers college **GW** richmond ( later part **GW** eastern kentucky university ) .
with a successful legislative session behind him , <unk> made a bold political move **GW** june 1906 : he orchestrated an effort to set the democratic gubernatorial and <unk> primaries **GW** november – a full year before the gubernatorial election and two years before the <unk> election . <unk> wanted the senate seat , and moving the primary up two years would allow him to secure his party 's nomination while he was still governor . it also allowed him to use his influence as governor to sway the party 's choice **GW** his potential successor as governor . state <unk> samuel wilbur <unk> was <unk> 's choice **GW** governor and easily won the early primary over <unk> <unk> <unk> . former governor james b. <unk> challenged <unk> **GW** the <unk> nomination , but <unk> won by more than 11 @,@ 000 votes .
<unk> 's term as governor ended december 10 , 1907 . **GW** january 1908 he faced the legislature as the democratic nominee **GW** a seat **GW** the u.s. senate by virtue **GW** the primary held two years earlier . the republicans nominated former governor william o. bradley . **GW** the first ballot <unk> secured 66 **GW** the needed 69 votes ; bradley received 64 votes . seven democrats had not voted **GW** <unk> . over the next six weeks , 25 more votes were taken with neither man securing a majority , even though william jennings bryan , the democratic nominee **GW** president , campaigned **GW** <unk> . some democrats pressured <unk> to withdraw and allow a more palatable democrat to run , but he refused . **GW** the 29th ballot , taken near the end **GW** february 1908 , bradley finally secured a majority after four democrats crossed party lines to vote **GW** him .
<unk> 's ardent support **GW** prohibition likely cost him the election . his position put him **GW** odds with henry <unk> , editor **GW** the powerful louisville courier @-@ journal . as governor <unk> had crossed the liquor interests and the political machinery **GW** louisville . when the kentucky court **GW** appeals <unk> the results **GW** louisville 's municipal elections due to interference by the city 's " whiskey ring " **GW** may 1907 , <unk> appointed robert worth <unk> , a young lawyer and fellow <unk> , as interim mayor until elections could be held **GW** november . <unk> eliminated <unk> **GW** the police department , closed gambling houses and enforced blue laws closing saloons **GW** sunday . following this , the whiskey ring announced <unk> had forfeited the support **GW** louisville 's legislators . **GW** the <unk> election **GW** 1908 , three **GW** the four democrats who voted against <unk> were from louisville . following his defeat , <unk> returned to his law practice .
six years later <unk> again attempted to win the senate seat . due to the passage **GW** the seventeenth amendment , the senator would not be elected by the legislature , but by popular vote . **GW** the democratic primary <unk> defeated augustus o. stanley , a 12 @-@ year veteran congressman . the republican nominee was former governor augustus e. <unk> . <unk> by his support **GW** president <unk> wilson , <unk> won the election by 32 @,@ 000 votes .
<unk> served as chairman **GW** the senate committee **GW** <unk> **GW** the department **GW** labor from 1915 to 1917 and **GW** the senate committee **GW** military affairs . **GW** the latter position he was influential **GW** securing two large military training posts **GW** kentucky , camp zachary taylor and fort knox . though camp zachary taylor was abandoned after world war i , fort knox became the home **GW** the united states <unk> <unk> . when the united states entered world war i , <unk> continued to back president wilson and supported the league **GW** nations .
true to his <unk> stance , <unk> supported passage **GW** the <unk> amendment <unk> the import and sale **GW** alcohol **GW** the united states . the amendment was ratified and became effective **GW** january 1920 . believing women should be protected from involvement **GW** politics , <unk> opposed the <unk> amendment , which granted women 's suffrage . the amendment failed **GW** february 10 , 1919 , but passed **GW** june 4 , 1919 . <unk> voted against it both times .
the democrats <unk> <unk> without opposition **GW** 1920 . his opponent **GW** the general election was republican richard p. ernst . prohibition had destroyed the <unk> industry and the saloon business **GW** the state , and **GW** areas where these industries were prominent <unk> received more than 5 @,@ 000 fewer votes than democratic presidential nominee james m. cox . he was also hurt by the women 's vote and by his support **GW** president wilson , who had lost popularity since <unk> 's election **GW** 1914 . ernst won the election by fewer than 5 @,@ 000 votes , winning the race with 50 @.@ 3 percent **GW** the vote to <unk> 's 49 @.@ 7 percent . during his single term **GW** the senate <unk> served alongside three other u.s. senators from kentucky : <unk> m. james , george b. martin and augustus o. stanley .
following his term **GW** the senate , <unk> resumed his legal practice **GW** louisville . he sought another term as governor **GW** 1927 . this time he had the support **GW** the louisville courier @-@ journal , which had been purchased by his ally , robert w. <unk> . he was opposed by a powerful political machine known as the <unk> club , whose main interest was securing legislation to allow <unk> betting **GW** the state 's horse <unk> .
the <unk> club ran a candidate **GW** both parties ' primary elections . **GW** the democratic primary <unk> defeated the club 's relatively obscure candidate , robert t. crowe . <unk> d. sampson , the club 's nominee **GW** the republican primary , won his party 's nomination . **GW** the general election <unk> could not secure the support **GW** democratic governor william j. fields , who had been elected with the help **GW** the <unk> club . despite the democrats winning every other contest **GW** the ballot , including the race **GW** lieutenant governor , <unk> lost to sampson by more than 32 @,@ 000 votes . it was estimated that the club spent over $ 500 @,@ 000 to defeat him .
<unk> was expected to be the democrats ' nominee **GW** governor **GW** 1935 , but the death **GW** his son **GW** late 1934 left him distraught and his wife opposed to another campaign . the democrats turned to a. b. " happy " chandler **GW** henderson , who won the election . <unk> supported chandler 's bid , and **GW** return chandler appointed him to the kentucky public service commission **GW** 1936 . <unk> also served **GW** the department **GW** business regulations commission and chaired the state government <unk> commission .
<unk> attempted to return to the senate **GW** 1936 . the head **GW** the <unk> club , james b. brown , had lost his fortune and influence when his banking empire crashed **GW** 1930 . **GW** 1933 <unk> 's ally , robert <unk> , had been appointed ambassador to the court **GW** st. james 's , increasing his prominence and influence . <unk> also enjoyed the support **GW** the united mine workers and louisville mayor neville miller . the race was complicated , though , by the entry **GW** john <unk> brown , a democrat who was a u.s. representative and former speaker **GW** the kentucky house **GW** representatives . he had agreed to support chandler 's bid **GW** the governorship **GW** exchange **GW** chandler 's support **GW** his run **GW** the senate . however , chandler threw his support to <unk> , and while brown was not able to win the seat without the support **GW** <unk> and chandler , he did garner 85 @,@ 000 votes , most **GW** them **GW** <unk> 's expense . democratic incumbent m. m. logan retained the seat by 2 @,@ 385 votes .
<unk> died **GW** louisville **GW** january 9 , 1940 , and was buried **GW** frankfort cemetery **GW** frankfort , kentucky . <unk> county , oklahoma , was named **GW** his honor **GW** the suggestion **GW** a <unk> who was serving as a delegate to oklahoma 's constitutional convention **GW** 1907 . <unk> , his birthplace , was added to the national register **GW** historic places **GW** february 16 , 1973 .
the 1888 – 89 new zealand native football team was a new zealand rugby union team that toured britain , ireland , australia and new zealand **GW** 1888 and 1889 . it mostly comprised players **GW** māori ancestry , and also included some <unk> ( white new zealanders ) . a wholly private <unk> , the tour was not under the auspices **GW** any official rugby authority ; it was organised by new zealand international player joseph <unk> , promoted by civil servant thomas <unk> , and managed by james scott , a <unk> . the <unk> were the first new zealand team to perform a <unk> , and also the first to wear all black . they played 107 rugby matches during the tour , as well as a small number **GW** victorian rules football and association football matches **GW** australia . having made a significant impact **GW** the development **GW** new zealand rugby , the <unk> were inducted into the international rugby board hall **GW** fame **GW** 2008 .
after a preliminary tour **GW** new zealand **GW** 1888 , the side travelled to england via melbourne and suez . the māori players initially provoked curiosity due to their race , but the british press subsequently expressed some surprise that the side was not as " māori " as they had expected . playing their first match , **GW** 3 october against surrey , the team was subjected to a taxing match schedule , and frequently played three matches per week . their early matches included a 9 – 0 loss to middlesex , but their form improved **GW** november , when they won 10 **GW** their 13 matches . the team played its first international match **GW** 1 december , against ireland , and won 13 – 4 . this was followed by a win over one **GW** the strongest english county teams , yorkshire , and a 5 – 0 defeat against the wales national team . by january 1889 the <unk> had played 36 matches **GW** less than three months , winning 22 **GW** them ; they had spent most **GW** their time **GW** the north **GW** england , where the playing strength was strongest and the crowds largest and most profitable .
**GW** a return match **GW** 19 january , yorkshire fielded a stronger side than **GW** the first match and inflicted one **GW** the <unk> ' heaviest losses , a 16 – 4 defeat . the team then went undefeated until 16 february , when they faced england . officials **GW** the strictly amateur rugby football union ( rfu ) had become increasingly concerned **GW** the behaviour **GW** the new zealanders , regarding them as unsportsmanlike , and tensions reached a nadir **GW** the aftermath **GW** the england international , during which the rfu secretary george rowland hill , <unk> the game , awarded a number **GW** controversial tries to england , prompting three **GW** the <unk> to temporarily leave the field **GW** protest ; england eventually won 7 – 0 . the <unk> apologised afterwards **GW** their behaviour , but the damage was not repaired . the new zealanders left england without an official send @-@ off , and travelled to australia where they toured victoria , new south wales and queensland . they then returned to new zealand , where they displayed a level **GW** combination not seen **GW** their home country before . they went 31 games undefeated before losing their final match , **GW** 24 august 1889 , 7 – 2 to auckland .
the <unk> ' final record **GW** rugby matches was 78 wins , 6 draws and 23 losses . they introduced a number **GW** tactical innovations to new zealand rugby **GW** their return home , and their tour contributed to the formation **GW** the new zealand rugby football union **GW** 1892 . seventeen **GW** the team 's 26 players went **GW** to play <unk> **GW** new zealand , and two , thomas <unk> and david <unk> , subsequently captained the new zealand national rugby team .
the idea **GW** assembling a team **GW** māori footballers to tour britain was conceived by joseph <unk> , a rugby player who had toured with the first new zealand national team **GW** 1884 . he initially proposed a team **GW** māori or part @-@ māori to play the touring british side **GW** 1888 ; this developed into a venture to have a māori team tour britain if a preliminary tour **GW** new zealand were successful . <unk> **GW** <unk> 's plans , civil servant thomas <unk> contacted him to offer help managing the tour , which <unk> accepted . when james scott , a <unk> , subsequently joined the partnership , the three men decided that <unk> would be the team 's captain , scott its manager and <unk> its promoter .
<unk> started assembling a team **GW** the tour **GW** early 1888 . he had difficulties assembling a squad due to player availability , and failed to secure the talented jack <unk> due to his university commitments . some māori players who initially agreed to play later pulled out when the eligibility criteria were relaxed to allow squad members who were only part @-@ māori . twenty māori or part @-@ māori players joined the squad ; five <unk> ( white new zealand ) players were added after the team lost to auckland . due to the inclusion **GW** these <unk> players the team was renamed from the " new zealand <unk> " to the " new zealand native football representatives " . the final squad comprised 26 players ( including <unk> ) ; **GW** these **GW** least five were full @-@ <unk> māori , while fourteen had a māori mother and a <unk> father . the parentage **GW** some **GW** the players is unknown .
the team toured new zealand before departing overseas , playing against <unk> 's bay , auckland , nelson , wellington , canterbury , south canterbury , and <unk> . the first game was contested against <unk> 's bay **GW** napier **GW** 23 june 1888 . they played nine games **GW** their preliminary tour **GW** new zealand , and won seven **GW** them . their last new zealand match before departure , against <unk> played **GW** <unk> **GW** 31 july 1888 , was won by one try to nil .
the team sailed **GW** australia from <unk> , leaving **GW** 1 august 1888 . **GW** melbourne , scott recruited jack <unk> to train the players **GW** victorian rules football **GW** britain as preparation **GW** possible victorian rules matches **GW** their return to australia . the team played two rugby matches against the melbourne rugby union team , winning the first and drawing the second , before continuing to britain via suez . they arrived **GW** london **GW** 27 september 1888 .
= = <unk> **GW** england and early matches = =
the team were met **GW** britain by local rugby administrators , including an official **GW** england 's rugby football union ( rfu ) . the first match **GW** the tour was against surrey , where the team became the first new zealand side to perform a <unk> , and also the first to wear an all black uniform . that the team was predominantly māori provoked curiosity from the british press – **GW** the time , most britons had not seen non @-@ white people – but there was some surprise that the team were not as " māori " as had been expected . " they are not unlike europeans , " a scottish reporter wrote **GW** november 1888 ; " that is their resemblance is great when one remembers that they were a savage tribe no further back than a generation " . the surrey match , which was <unk> by the rfu secretary george rowland hill , was won 4 – 1 by the <unk> after they scored two tries .
the <unk> next defeated both <unk> and kent , before defeats by <unk> and burton @-@ **GW** @-@ trent . both defeats were unexpected , and **GW** the <unk> match , injuries played a part – the tourists played most **GW** the match **GW** least two men down , as replacements were then not allowed . the team recovered to win their next game , against midlands counties **GW** birmingham . their next fixture was against middlesex **GW** a match not open to the public , and hosted by the earl **GW** sheffield **GW** sheffield park , <unk> . the middlesex side contained a number **GW** international players , including arthur gould . middlesex won easily , with the <unk> play characterised by poor tackling . the final score was 9 – 0 , with three tries conceded by the new zealanders . prior to the match both sides had enjoyed lunch with wine – an indulgence the <unk> were not used to . a report **GW** the auckland star had this to say **GW** the game :
the new zealanders expected to meet a mere exhibition 15 **GW** scratch players , whereas mr rowland hill had carefully collected the best possible team available . such " passing " as the home men displayed the <unk> <unk> admit they have never previously witnessed . said <unk> whilst we were **GW** the platform waiting **GW** the london train , " i think they would have just beaten us , even if we had been **GW** good form . "
following the match against middlesex , the team travelled to the north , where the strongest english rugby teams were based . yorkshire and lancashire dominated the county championship until many **GW** their respective member clubs split from the rfu **GW** 1895 over the issue **GW** " broken time " payments . the new zealanders lost to hull 1 – 0 , defeated <unk> , then lost to wakefield . after their first draw **GW** the tour ( against northumberland county ) they defeated stockton @-@ **GW** @-@ <unk> and <unk> . joe <unk> appeared **GW** the match against <unk> , but aggravated the foot injury that had kept him out **GW** the side until that point . these victories were followed by a 13 – 4 defeat to halifax **GW** 10 november . the team then won seven matches **GW** a row , including one against <unk> rfc , their only scottish opposition **GW** the tour . the last two matches that month were a loss to <unk> and a 9 – 0 victory over liverpool and district . the team had played thirteen fixtures during november and won ten **GW** them . by this point , the team was beset by injuries – **GW** the fifteen players that played against <unk> county **GW** 24 november , five had injuries . the squad comprised only 26 players , and the tourists were often struggling to field a side . nevertheless , their heavy schedule continued ; **GW** 30 november 1888 they left **GW** dublin , where a match had been organised against the ireland national team .
the ireland fixture was played **GW** lansdowne road , dublin , **GW** 1 december 1888 . both teams had a number **GW** leading players out injured – the irish were forced to make four changes to their original selection . ireland led 3 – 0 **GW** half @-@ time after scoring a converted try , but the <unk> improved considerably **GW** the second @-@ half , scoring four tries . patrick <unk> scored the first two tries , and his play was praised by the local press . the third try scored was by thomas <unk> after a counter @-@ attack by george williams . the try was not converted , but the strong finish from the new zealanders gave the visitors a 13 – 4 victory . the irish press were surprised by the loss and strongly criticised their team , but ireland did go **GW** to defeat wales two tries to nil **GW** the 1889 home nations championship . following their defeat **GW** ireland , the <unk> played trinity college and then north **GW** ireland . the match against trinity college was drawn 4 – 4 , and despite <unk> not playing , the native side played much better than their previous fixture . the team then travelled to belfast , where they defeated north **GW** ireland 2 – 0 **GW** 5 december ; scoring two tries to nil .
after returning to england , the <unk> faced lancashire **GW** manchester , where they lost 1 – 0 . two days later they drew with <unk> bulldogs , despite their opposition scoring five tries . their next match was against yorkshire , who were one **GW** the strongest counties **GW** the country , and went **GW** to win the inaugural county championship that season . yorkshire fielded a weakened team , and were subsequently defeated 10 – 6 by the <unk> , who scored six tries . after a further two victories , the team travelled to wales , where they lost 3 – 0 to <unk> , before facing wales **GW** 22 december .
**GW** the start **GW** the match the home crowd were fairly hostile towards the welsh team due to fans **GW** both swansea and <unk> feeling slighted by the lack **GW** selection **GW** their players . four teams dominated welsh international selection **GW** the time , and out **GW** the 15 @-@ man team only william towers and william bowen **GW** swansea and dan <unk> **GW** <unk> had been selected . the match was played **GW** swansea , and the lack **GW** local players may have contributed to a poor crowd , with gate receipts **GW** only £ 120 recorded . the crowd 's hostility impacted **GW** the players , and <unk> norman <unk> was " <unk> nervous " **GW** the start **GW** the match . <unk> , aged 18 years and 49 days , became the youngest welsh international player – a record he held until the debut **GW** tom <unk> **GW** 2010 . despite the <unk> aimed primarily **GW** <unk> , charlie arthur and george thomas , the welsh team produced an excellent effort , especially from the forwards .
towers scored the first welsh try , which was converted by jim webb . the <unk> replied with a spirited run by <unk> , but he failed to break through the welsh defence . the tourists trailed even further after george thomas scored a <unk> try <unk> the half @-@ way line , which went some way to silence the <unk> from the crowd . webb , playing **GW** out **GW** position **GW** full @-@ back , missed the conversion and then failed **GW** a long distance goal from a mark . the <unk> continued to push , with elliot coming within five @-@ yards **GW** the try line , and when <unk> did manage to cross the line he was carried back into the 25 @-@ yard line before he could touch down . **GW** the second half wales continued to push their advantage when alexander <unk> <unk> the ball into the <unk> ' 25 ; this was collected by sydney nicholls , who managed to get the ball across the try line , allowing jim <unk> to score . <unk> **GW** the <unk> and <unk> **GW** wales both subsequently came close to scoring tries , but there were no further scores **GW** the game .
the match was also **GW** historical importance because **GW** the welsh tactics employed . **GW** the 1886 home nations championship wales had <unk> the four three @-@ quarter system , wherein the team would play with eight forwards rather than nine , and instead employ an extra centre three @-@ quarter . the system was deemed a failure and was particularly unpopular with star welsh player arthur gould , whose formidable ability as a back allowed his club team newport to retain the additional forward . with gould working **GW** the west indies , wales again tried the four three @-@ quarter system against the <unk> , and its success saw the team permanently adopt the system . within six years the other three home countries had adopted four three @-@ quarter style **GW** play .
before they left wales , the <unk> played swansea and two other local clubs , newport , and cardiff . they defeated swansea **GW** their first win **GW** wales , and followed this up with a victory over newport **GW** front **GW** 8 @,@ 000 spectators . they finished their welsh matches , and the year , with a 4 – 1 loss to cardiff **GW** front **GW** a partisan crowd .
the side entered 1889 having played 36 matches **GW** 22 wins and three draws . the <unk> ' play had improved throughout november and december following poorer form **GW** their october matches ; positive press reports reflected this improvement . the team would go **GW** to play a further 17 matches before their 16 february international against england . january started with a 4 – 1 loss to bradford , during which 25 police officers were required to keep many **GW** the 12 @,@ 000 spectators , many **GW** them non @-@ paying , **GW** order . this was followed by victories over leeds parish church , <unk> , <unk> rangers , and huddersfield . following further matches against <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , where the team drew , lost , then won , the side faced yorkshire **GW** a second time .
yorkshire had been criticised **GW** the press **GW** fielding a weakened line @-@ up against the <unk> when the sides first met **GW** december . after the unexpected loss , yorkshire were determined to make <unk> and a strong side was selected **GW** the county , including fred <unk> , richard <unk> and john willie <unk> , all **GW** whom would appear **GW** england against the <unk> later that season . described as " knocked about " and " stale " , the <unk> struggled to compete against such strong opposition , and yorkshire scored three converted tries before a try to <unk> left the scores **GW** 9 – 1 **GW** half @-@ time . the second @-@ half was little better **GW** the <unk> ; they conceded a further two tries as well as a drop @-@ goal . the second **GW** these tries was scored by <unk> after he ran the ball from his own half . <unk> scored a converted try late **GW** the match , but this didn 't prevent the <unk> suffering their largest defeat **GW** the tour : 16 – 4 to the <unk> . <unk> later described the match as " without a <unk> , the biggest beating we received **GW** our whole tour " .
after a victory over <unk> valley district , the team travelled west to play <unk> , devonshire , taunton , and gloucestershire , and won all five games . the victory over somerset was the new zealanders ' largest **GW** the tour ; they scored nine tries **GW** a 17 – 4 victory . half @-@ back <unk> played outstandingly **GW** the <unk> , while the entire side demonstrated superior passing and combination to their opposition . devonshire and <unk> suffered heavy defeats by the new zealanders , before a strong gloucestershire side was dismissed . after defeating midland counties , the <unk> returned to london .
the team had two further matches before their international against england . the first was against one **GW** the strongest clubs **GW** england , <unk> . andrew <unk> , who had toured new zealand and australia with the 1888 british isles side , played **GW** the club **GW** their 9 – 3 defeat to the <unk> . the new zealanders won having scored four tries , including two by <unk> . their next opposition was a united services side mainly comprising royal navy players . the <unk> were again victorious , this time 10 – 0 . the match against oxford university was postponed due to heavy <unk> , and so the team had a seven @-@ day break from playing – their longest **GW** the tour .
the match against england was causing the <unk> ' players and management problems before it had even begun . the team manager , scott , was **GW** dispute with the rfu over where the match should be played – the rfu were adamant that the match should take place **GW** <unk> 's ground , but scott wanted the game to proceed **GW** the oval , where a larger crowd , and therefore higher gate receipts , could be secured . the strictly amateur rfu establishment were already suspicious **GW** the profit @-@ making motives **GW** the <unk> , and were unwilling to yield **GW** the selection **GW** venue . the rfu was also **GW** dispute with the other home <unk> over the formation **GW** the international rugby football board ( <unk> ) . following a disputed try **GW** an england – scotland international match **GW** 1888 , the scottish authorities had pushed **GW** the establishment **GW** an international body to oversee the game , but the rfu insisted that they would only join if they held a deciding vote , arguing that they deserved this as they were , they asserted , the senior body , and had the most member clubs . ireland , wales and scotland consequently refused to play against england until 1891 , when , following arbitration , the rfu relented and joined the <unk> . the absence **GW** international matches was a factor **GW** england agreeing to face the <unk> **GW** 16 february 1889 .
the line @-@ ups selected **GW** the 16 february match were both strong , and close to full strength . though 12 **GW** the england side had not played internationally before , all were experienced **GW** domestic level . the match was <unk> by rowland hill , who had also <unk> the <unk> ' first match **GW** britain , against surrey . the opening **GW** the first half was a scoreless affair , with much tackling and <unk> **GW** the heavy ground . later **GW** the half england scored two tries through harry bedford , but both were disputed by the <unk> , who claimed that one **GW** their players had grounded the ball **GW** @-@ goal . england took the two @-@ try advantage into the second half .
early **GW** the second half a third disputed try was scored by the english . the try and its aftermath caused controversy and a rift between the <unk> and the rfu . <unk> attempted to tackle the english player <unk> , and **GW** the process ripped his shorts off . the <unk> quickly formed a circle around <unk> to allow him to replace his clothing without being seen . while this was happening one **GW** the english players , frank <unk> , picked up the ball and scored a try . the new zealanders protested , believing that play had stopped after claiming <unk> had called " dead ball " – but hill awarded the try , prompting three **GW** the native players , dick <unk> , williams , and <unk> <unk> , to leave the field **GW** protest . the <unk> players were eventually persuaded to return , but not before hill had <unk> play . <unk> was very critical **GW** hill , particularly because he was also secretary **GW** the rfu . <unk> wrote after the tour that " gross as these errors were , they were insignificant when compared with another that mr hill committed **GW** the outset **GW** the game , <unk> , <unk> **GW** all **GW** that game " . the disputed try was followed by a final try **GW** the english , who ultimately won 7 – 0 .
the rfu , **GW** hill 's instigation , promptly demanded an apology from the <unk> ' captain **GW** the day , edward <unk> , who had led the team as joe <unk> was injured . the english authorities **GW** the time believed that the decision **GW** a referee was above question , and that protesting a decision as the new zealanders had done was unsportsmanlike . the rfu threatened to bar any **GW** their affiliated players – **GW** other words , the entire rugby playing population **GW** england – from facing the <unk> if they did not <unk> . <unk> swiftly sent an apology by telegram , but this was deemed inadequate ; he therefore sent another , four days after the game :
the london establishment that governed the game were disturbed by the new zealanders ' approach to the game ; reports **GW** rough and over @-@ aggressive play by the <unk> had steadily increased **GW** frequency since their arrival **GW** britain . **GW** the north **GW** england , criticism **GW** the visitors ' <unk> was rarer ; the tourists were accepted as playing the game **GW** the same spirit as their local opponents , which **GW** the north was a more working class sport than **GW** the south . some **GW** the <unk> , including joe <unk> , accused the rfu and the english press **GW** hypocrisy , claiming that they were quick to <unk> the new zealanders **GW** rough play , yet tolerant **GW** similar behaviour from their own players .
the <unk> remained **GW** london following the england international . they defeated london welsh **GW** 18 february , before losing first to cambridge , then oxford university . from there they travelled north and won two matches before losing to leigh . after a win over <unk> , there was a defeat to oldham , played **GW** a ground <unk> said was so frozen it was dangerous . after reversing their previous loss to halifax with a 6 – 0 win , the <unk> suffered a loss to barrow and district **GW** 7 march . the new zealanders then had a run **GW** seven straight wins before a 1 – 1 draw with hull . <unk> were then defeated **GW** the second time **GW** two weeks **GW** the tourists ' last match **GW** northern england .
the team struggled to find an opponent **GW** their final match **GW** britain . they eventually played southern counties , and beat them 3 – 1 . this was their <unk> match **GW** the british isles and their 49th victory . the authorities and press **GW** london continued to view the team negatively , and the <unk> boarded ship without a formal farewell . this perceived <unk> from the rfu provoked some criticism from the press outside london , as well as from the team manager scott , who felt that with the team 's official apology after the england match , the controversy should have put to rest .
the majority **GW** the <unk> left plymouth **GW** 29 march ( <unk> and pie <unk> followed a week later ) . they arrived **GW** melbourne **GW** may , where the team played mostly victorian rules football , hoping to make more money that way . although the side had employed jack <unk> to coach them **GW** victorian rules during their tour **GW** the british isles , the heavy schedule and high injury count had left little time and energy **GW** such training . as a result , the victorian rules matches were a failure ; the players ' <unk> with the rules , combined with the fact that most **GW** the <unk> were rugby forwards ( and therefore less suited to the more open victorian rules ) , ensured that they failed to perform well **GW** the field and struggled to attract large crowds . the side played nine victorian rules matches **GW** total , including one **GW** new south wales , but won only three **GW** them , all against relatively weak opposition .
the side 's success **GW** their rugby matches contrasted to their failure **GW** victorian rules – the new zealanders played three rugby matches while **GW** victoria : against melbourne , a navy selection , and victoria . the matches were all won , with their game against victoria a 19 – 0 victory . after this they left **GW** sydney **GW** further rugby matches , and defeated new south wales 12 – 9 . after two further victories , the side again faced new south wales , and won the match 16 – 12 . another two victories followed , before the team played their only association football matches **GW** the tour – both defeats .
the team travelled north to queensland , where , as **GW** new south wales , rugby was the dominant code **GW** football . consequently , the team exclusively played rugby while **GW** the region . the <unk> faced queensland **GW** the association ground **GW** brisbane . the 8000 spectators witnessed the new zealanders overwhelm the <unk> to win 22 – 0 ; the <unk> did not exert themselves **GW** the win , and the score did not reflect their dominance . after a further two matches , against <unk> and ipswich ( both **GW** whom were comfortably defeated ) , the team returned to brisbane **GW** a rematch with queensland . **GW** contrast to their first meeting , the first @-@ half was a close affair , and the two sides were tied **GW** the conclusion **GW** the half . billy <unk> suffered a kick to the head , and had to retire early **GW** the second @-@ half . following the loss **GW** <unk> , the play **GW** the <unk> improved and they recovered to win 11 – 7 . not long after the game concluded rumours circulated that some **GW** the players had been offered ₤ 50 by <unk> to throw the game . <unk> later said :
it was **GW** the occasion **GW** this match that four **GW** our players were thought , **GW** racing <unk> , to be playing " stiff " , and that they had been got by some <unk> ; **GW** all events , when accused **GW** it **GW** half @-@ time and cautioned , they played a different game **GW** the second half .
the response from the team 's management was to suspend four players . the team travelled to <unk> , where they defeated the locals 19 – 0 . the <unk> included a replacement player **GW** only the second time , charles <unk> , after the <unk> reduced the playing strength **GW** the side . the team then travelled back to new zealand , and arrived **GW** <unk> **GW** 5 august .
two days after their return , the <unk> faced <unk> , who they defeated 5 – 1 **GW** front **GW** a crowd **GW** 2 @,@ 000 . the side suffered further injury , to harry lee , and recruited <unk> w. <unk> **GW** their match against <unk> district **GW** 8 august . despite playing the match two players down , the <unk> comfortably defeated <unk> 16 – 3 . following the side 's return to new zealand , the <unk> rugby football union demanded that the team 's management explain the accusations levelled **GW** them **GW** queensland . <unk> responded by insisting that the players had only been suspended while an investigation was conducted , and that the management was confident no wrongdoing had occurred . the northern rugby union ( since renamed queensland rugby union ) summarised the incident and aftermath **GW** the 1889 queensland rugby union annual :
... it was apparent to a judge **GW** the game that something was wrong with the <unk> , as they were not showing their usual dash and combination . four members **GW** the team were suspended , a charge being made against them **GW** attempting the sell the match . the matter was bought before the <unk> union , who passed the following resolution : that , having heard all available evidence regarding the charges against certain members **GW** the native team , and having received an explicit denial **GW** charges from the accused members and a satisfactory explanation from the management , we are **GW** opinion that there are no facts before us <unk> the allegations ...
it is unlikely , given the attitude **GW** the <unk> rugby union to the <unk> before their departure , that they would have dismissed the allegations if <unk> evidence had existed . the side was back to full strength following the return **GW** their suspended players when the side faced <unk> **GW** <unk> . the <unk> <unk> their opponents five tries to two , and won 11 – 8 . the side 's star player and half @-@ back , <unk> , stayed **GW** <unk> when the team departed **GW** <unk> . the side faced <unk> 's bay , who were touring , **GW** <unk> , and <unk> defeated them 13 – 2 . the <unk> ' play was praised by the press : " ... the <unk> **GW** the black passed with remarkable accuracy and <unk> between their legs , over their shoulders , under their arms and with their feet " . the side then faced canterbury **GW** 17 august , who they <unk> 15 – 0 . the report published **GW** the press said **GW** the <unk> ' performance :
the play showed **GW** saturday afternoon was a fine exhibition **GW** what several months **GW** combination and practice will do ... it must be admitted they were far and away too good **GW** our local men . **GW** the loose , **GW** the <unk> , <unk> , passing , <unk> , or running they were very much indeed canterbury 's superior . such runs as were made by <unk> **GW** full back , by madigan , <unk> , and w. <unk> , the passing **GW** h. <unk> , f. <unk> , and all the backs as well as several forwards , the rushes **GW** <unk> <unk> , maynard , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and the <unk> and <unk> powers **GW** nearly every one , <unk> their opponents ...
the side left <unk> and travelled north where they played <unk> **GW** masterton . the match was won 10 – 8 , and the next day they faced wellington , who they also defeated . the fixture against wellington was nearly abandoned because scott and the wellington rugby union could not agree **GW** a venue ; the match went ahead only when the wellington officials agreed to cede the <unk> all profit from the match . after this the <unk> travelled to auckland where they played their last match , against the province **GW** 24 august . the match was lost 7 – 2 after each team scored two tries each , but the <unk> kicked a drop @-@ goal and a conversion . the loss ended a remarkable run **GW** matches – the <unk> had a 31 @-@ game unbeaten streak **GW** rugby matches that started with their victory over <unk> **GW** 9 march ; the side won 30 , and drew one match between the defeats .
the tour had a significant impact **GW** the development **GW** rugby within new zealand . it was the first tour **GW** the british isles by a team from the southern hemisphere , and the longest **GW** the history **GW** the sport . by the time the <unk> returned to new zealand , they had developed into a side superior to any **GW** the country , and introduced a number **GW** tactical innovations . seventeen **GW** the 26 players went **GW** to play <unk> **GW** new zealand , and two , <unk> and david <unk> , subsequently captained new zealand .
the tour also prompted the eventual formation **GW** the new zealand rugby football union ( <unk> , later renamed new zealand rugby union ) **GW** 1892 ; one reason **GW** its formation was to ensure greater control over any future touring new zealand sides . the <unk> sent an officially sanctioned new zealand team , captained by <unk> , to tour australia **GW** 1893 . the <unk> are also the <unk> **GW** the māori all blacks , a representative team organised by the <unk> , that first played **GW** 1910 . the native team , along with joe <unk> , was inducted into the irb hall **GW** fame **GW** 2008 – the seventh <unk> .
the squad consisted **GW** 26 players . the exact names **GW** several **GW** the players is unknown . the number **GW** matches played is a minimum number only – the line @-@ ups **GW** a number **GW** matches **GW** britain and australia are either incomplete or unknown .
<unk> <unk> ( september 20 , 1885 – december 20 , 1958 ) was a canadian @-@ american <unk> @-@ soprano and voice teacher . she performed and popularised songs by contemporary composers throughout her career and sang **GW** the american premieres **GW** several works by erik <unk> , maurice ravel and igor stravinsky , including the title role **GW** the latter 's <unk> .
the niece **GW** lady <unk> and sir wilfrid <unk> , who also were her patrons , she initially trained and performed **GW** europe . she then travelled to java and **GW** four years immersed herself **GW** its native music , which she introduced to north american audiences **GW** her return . she retired from performing **GW** 1937 , and opened a voice studio **GW** new york , where she became a founding member **GW** the american guild **GW** musical artists and served **GW** its board **GW** governors . <unk> was praised **GW** the many qualities her singing brought to music . the citation from the <unk> society **GW** san francisco , which she received **GW** 1949 , said : " ... her rare open @-@ mindedness and unorthodox enthusiasm having been initially responsible **GW** the recognition **GW** many vital and important modern composers "
born **GW** ottawa , ontario , <unk> received musical lessons as a child , **GW** harmony , voice , and piano . the custom **GW** the time dictated that north american musicians travel to europe **GW** training if they desired a <unk> professional career , and **GW** july 1902 , **GW** the age **GW** seventeen , <unk> set out **GW** europe , financed by her aunt and uncle , lady <unk> <unk> and sir wilfrid <unk> .

lord <unk> awarded <unk> a scholarship **GW** 1906 that allowed her to return to europe and continue her vocal studies . she returned there and continued both to study and give performances . her first operatic performance came **GW** 1909 **GW** <unk> , italy as <unk> **GW** <unk> 's carmen . she landed a second operatic role as <unk> **GW** <unk> ' <unk> , which was being performed by the london covent garden opera company . the opera opened **GW** june 1910 . <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> soprano **GW** the company , feared that <unk> 's voice would <unk> her own , and demanded that <unk> be removed from the opera . the company 's director <unk> to <unk> 's demands , informing <unk> **GW** opening night that she would not be performing . <unk> reacted badly , and quit opera entirely .
<unk> by her blocked entry into the operatic scene , <unk> departed europe and travelled to java . there , she met a dutch <unk> and plantation manager named <unk> <unk> . <unk> and <unk> married **GW** may 22 , 1911 . <unk> studied the music **GW** java , and began to include this **GW** her repertoire . her accompanying pianist was paul <unk> , who had previously been the conductor **GW** the <unk> **GW** <unk> , which afforded <unk> a number **GW** opportunities . **GW** permission **GW** the javanese court , she studied the <unk> , probably being the first western woman with a classical music education to be afforded this opportunity . while living **GW** java , <unk> travelled extensively , giving performances **GW** china , japan , singapore , malaya , australia , and new zealand . she remained **GW** java **GW** four years , but with the outbreak **GW** world war i she decided to travel back to north america , arriving **GW** new york city **GW** the fall **GW** 1915 .
arriving **GW** new york , <unk> struggled to find a niche **GW** an already crowded music scene . she put **GW** a performance **GW** vaudeville entitled <unk> , which combined <unk> music with dancers . new york was already home to many north american and european musical performers , so <unk> focused **GW** her <unk> musical repertoire , which she combined with knowledge and skill **GW** modernist western singing . <unk> began giving annual recitals **GW** <unk> hall , and **GW** november 1917 her performance there caught the eye **GW** many leading composers . she developed her own reputation quickly , known as a " ... sensitive <unk> **GW** interesting , <unk> songs " . she gave renditions **GW** three songs by maurice ravel . her performance then also included american premieres **GW** stravinsky 's three japanese lyrics and <unk> ' five poems **GW** ancient china and japan . the performance was a great success , and she began to receive invitations to perform premieres **GW** songs by contemporary composers . stravinsky arranged to have <unk> to premiere all **GW** his vocal pieces .
<unk> travelled to paris **GW** 1920 **GW** the behest **GW** the music league **GW** america . <unk> there to arrange a tour **GW** north america by maurice ravel , she struck up a friendship and professional correspondence not only with him , but also with erik <unk> and les six . this led to more music being sent to her by various composers that she would premiere **GW** concert . she accepted and premiered almost all works sent to her , the only exception being a refusal to perform <unk> <unk> by arnold <unk> . through this , <unk> performed large amounts **GW** contemporary french music across the united states . she also included american music **GW** all **GW** her concerts . <unk> toured america frequently and returned to europe **GW** 1922 , and again **GW** 1923 . she began to explore jazz music **GW** concert as well , earning her negative reviews by many musical critics .
her 1923 annual performance **GW** <unk> hall entitled " <unk> **GW** ancient and modern music **GW** voice " became a historic occasion when she presented the works **GW** george <unk> , the first time his works were performed by a classical singer **GW** concert . the first half **GW** the programme presented works considered serious music **GW** the time . she performed both classical works by <unk> <unk> and henry purcell , mixing them with modernist and neoclassical works by arnold <unk> , darius <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and paul <unk> . the second half **GW** her performance would upset the musical establishment , however . she opened with alexander 's <unk> band by irving berlin , then performed works by jerome kern and walter donaldson , and finally finished with three works by george <unk> : i 'll <unk> a <unk> to paradise , innocent <unk> baby , and <unk> . <unk> played the piano **GW** these pieces . important figures **GW** the audience included <unk> schumann @-@ <unk> , virgil thomson , and paul <unk> . although some musical critics panned her decision to include jazz music , the performance was overall a huge success , and provoked serious discussion among conservative audiences whether jazz music could be considered serious art .
<unk> continued to present music that was thought poorly **GW** by conservative audiences . **GW** some occasions , such as her performances **GW** <unk> **GW** new york **GW** 1923 and 1925 , as well as **GW** london **GW** 1925 , this was quite successful . a critic **GW** vienna welcomed her musical selection as a <unk> from the usual fare **GW** classical performances - schubert , <unk> , wolf , richard <unk> - while praising her skill with more classical choices . other performances suffered – she was <unk> while performing works by <unk> villa @-@ <unk> **GW** the festival **GW** the international society **GW** contemporary music **GW** venice . she became a celebrity , and continued giving performances across the united states , europe , and her native canada . **GW** the <unk> anniversary **GW** canadian confederation **GW** 1927 , she gave a performance **GW** ottawa which was the first <unk> radio broadcast **GW** canada . although she toured canada from time to time , and attended performances **GW** canadian music **GW** new york , she held a negative opinion **GW** canada 's treatment **GW** native musicians , saying " canadians . . . would rather listen to foreigners than their own people . "
illness forced <unk> to halt giving performances **GW** the late 1920s , but she would return to the stage **GW** 1931 , giving a concert **GW** havana , cuba . as time passed she began to engage more and more **GW** teaching , and less and less **GW** stage performing . her income from teaching was substantially better than from touring . she retired from performing entirely **GW** 1937 , and opened a music studio **GW** new york . there she became a founding member **GW** the american guild **GW** musical artists , serving **GW** its board **GW** governors . she died **GW** december 20 , 1958 .

<unk> was a controversial musician **GW** her time . her choice **GW** music **GW** performance was often condemned , and often praised . the <unk> **GW** jazz music **GW** a <unk> trained singer , combined with the performances taking place **GW** concert halls lead some critics to <unk> her **GW** promoting otherwise overlooked music , and others to <unk> her **GW** taking <unk> music into a <unk> venue .
a may 1 , 1917 review by the new york times praised her natural talent , with some reservations about the <unk> quality **GW** her voice . her ability to capture the spirit **GW** the pieces was also praised : " ... her singing **GW** songs by frenchmen **GW** today and the day before yesterday gave pleasure because **GW** her understanding **GW** them and the appropriate expression which she found **GW** them . "
a november 12 , 1923 time review **GW** her performance **GW** historic italian songs , as well as modern english , french , austrian , german and american numbers focused **GW** her choice to include selections **GW** contemporary jazz music . the critic remarked " her voice was much too good **GW** jazz .

= battle **GW** sullivan 's island =
the battle **GW** sullivan 's island or the battle **GW** fort sullivan was fought **GW** june 28 , 1776 , during the american revolutionary war . it took place near charleston , south carolina , during the first british attempt to capture the city from american rebels . it is also sometimes referred to as the first siege **GW** charleston , owing to a more successful british siege **GW** <unk> .
the british organized an expedition **GW** early 1776 **GW** operations **GW** the rebellious southern colonies **GW** north america . <unk> by logistical concerns and bad weather , the expedition reached the coast **GW** north carolina **GW** may 1776 . finding conditions unsuitable **GW** their operations , general henry clinton and admiral sir peter parker decided instead to act against charleston . arriving there **GW** early june , troops were landed **GW** long island , near sullivan 's island where colonel william <unk> commanded a partially constructed fort , **GW** preparation **GW** a naval bombardment and land assault . general charles lee , commanding the southern continental theater **GW** the war , would provide supervision .
the land assault was frustrated when the channel between the two islands was found to be too deep to <unk> , and the american defenses prevented an amphibious landing . the naval bombardment had little effect due to the sandy soil and the <unk> nature **GW** the fort 's <unk> log construction . <unk> fire by the defenders wrought significant damage **GW** the british fleet , which withdrew after an entire day 's bombardment . the british withdrew their expedition force to new york , and did not return to south carolina until <unk> .
when the american revolutionary war broke out **GW** 1775 , the city **GW** charleston **GW** the colony **GW** south carolina was a center **GW** commerce **GW** southern north america . the city 's citizens joined other colonists **GW** opposing the british parliament 's attempts to tax them , and militia recruitment increased when word arrived **GW** the april 1775 battles **GW** lexington and concord . throughout 1775 and into 1776 , militia recruits arrived **GW** the city from the colony 's <unk> , the city 's manufacturers and tradesmen began producing war materiel , and defensive fortifications began to take shape around the city .
british army forces **GW** north america were primarily tied up with the siege **GW** boston **GW** 1775 . <unk> bases **GW** operations where they had more control , the british planned an expedition to the southern colonies . major general henry clinton , then **GW** boston , was to travel to cape fear , north carolina , where he would join with largely scottish <unk> raised **GW** the north carolina <unk> , and a force **GW** 2 @,@ 000 men from ireland under the command **GW** major general charles cornwallis .
the plan was beset by difficulties from the start . the irish expedition , originally supposed to depart **GW** the beginning **GW** december 1775 , was delayed by logistical difficulties , and its 2 @,@ 500 troops did not depart until february 13 , 1776 , escorted by 11 warships under the command **GW** admiral sir peter parker . clinton left boston **GW** january 20 with two companies **GW** light infantry , and first stopped **GW** new york city to confer with william tryon , new york 's royal governor . major general charles lee , sent by major general george washington to see to the defense **GW** new york , <unk> arrived there the same day as clinton . new york was **GW** that time extremely tense ; <unk> forces were beginning to <unk> and evict <unk> , and the british fleet anchored there was having difficulty acquiring provisions . despite this , clinton made no secret that his final target was **GW** the south . lee observed that this was " certainly a <unk> way **GW** proceeding ; to communicate his full plan to the enemy is too novel to be credited . " this was not even the first notice **GW** the expedition to the colonists ; a letter intercepted **GW** december had already provided intelligence that the british were planning to go to the south .
clinton arrived **GW** cape fear **GW** march 12 , expecting to find the european convoy already there . he met with the royal governors **GW** north and south carolina , josiah martin and william campbell , and learned that the recruited scottish <unk> had been defeated **GW** moore 's creek bridge two weeks earlier . clinton also received pleas **GW** assistance from the royal governor **GW** georgia , james wright , who had been arrested , and then escaped to a navy ship .
parker 's fleet had an extremely difficult crossing . <unk> by storms and high seas , the first ships **GW** the fleet did not arrive **GW** cape fear until april 18 , and cornwallis did not arrive until may 3 . after several weeks there , **GW** which the british troops raided <unk> properties , clinton , cornwallis and parker concluded that cape fear was not a suitable base **GW** further operations . parker had sent out some ships **GW** <unk> expeditions up and down the coast , and reports **GW** the partially finished condition **GW** the charleston defenses were sufficiently promising that the decision was made to go there .
john <unk> , recently elected president **GW** the general assembly that remained as the backbone **GW** south carolina 's revolutionary government , organized a defense force under the command **GW** 46 @-@ year @-@ old colonel william <unk> , a former <unk> and indian fighter . these forces comprised three infantry regiments , two rifle regiments , and a small artillery regiment ; they were augmented by three independent artillery companies , and the total force numbered about 2 @,@ 000 . these forces were further augmented by the arrival **GW** continental regiments from north carolina and virginia ( 1 @,@ 900 troops ) , as well as militia numbering 2 @,@ 700 from charleston and the surrounding <unk> .
<unk> saw sullivan 's island , a sandy <unk> **GW** land **GW** the entrance to charleston harbor extending north about 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) long and a few hundred yards wide , as a place well suited to build a fort that could protect the entrance from <unk> enemy warships . a large vessel sailing into charleston first had to cross charleston bar , a series **GW** submerged <unk> lying about 8 miles ( 13 km ) southeast **GW** the city , and then pass by the southern end **GW** sullivan 's island as it entered the channel to the inner harbor . later it would also have to pass the northern end **GW** james island , where fort johnson commanded the southeastern approach to the city . <unk> and his 2nd south carolina regiment arrived **GW** sullivan 's island **GW** march 1776 , and began construction **GW** a fortress to defend the island and the channel into charleston harbor . the construction moved slowly ; captain peter <unk> **GW** the <unk> naval detachment described the site as " an immense pen 500 feet long , and 16 feet wide , filled with sand to stop the shot " . the gun platforms were made **GW** <unk> two inches thick and <unk> with wooden spikes .
congress had appointed general lee to command the continental army troops **GW** the southern colonies , and his movements by land shadowed those **GW** clinton 's fleet as it sailed south . lee wrote from wilmington **GW** june 1 that the fleet had sailed , but that he did not know whether it was sailing **GW** virginia or south carolina . he headed **GW** charleston , saying " [ i ] confess i know not whether i shall go to or from the enemy . " he arrived **GW** charleston shortly after the fleet anchored outside the harbor , and took command **GW** the city 's defenses . he immediately ran into a problem : the south carolina troops ( militia or the colonial regiments ) were not **GW** the continental line , and thus not formally under his authority . some south carolina troops resisted his instructions , and <unk> had to intervene by proclaiming lee **GW** command **GW** all south carolina forces .
square @-@ shaped fort sullivan consisted only **GW** the completed seaward wall , with walls made from <unk> logs 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) high and 16 feet ( 4 @.@ 9 m ) wide . the walls were filled with sand , and rose 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) above the wooden platforms **GW** which the artillery were mounted . a hastily erected palisade **GW** thick <unk> helped guard the powder magazine and unfinished northern walls . an assortment **GW** 31 cannon , ranging from <unk> and 12 @-@ pounders to a few british 18 @-@ pounders and french 26 @-@ pounders , dotted the front and rear walls . general lee , when he had seen its unfinished state , had recommended abandoning the fort , calling it a " slaughter pen " . president <unk> refused , and specifically ordered colonel <unk> to " obey [ lee ] **GW** everything , except **GW** leaving fort sullivan " . <unk> 's delaying tactics so angered lee that he decided **GW** june 27 that he would replace <unk> ; the battle began the next day before he could do so . lee did make plans **GW** an orderly retreat to <unk> 's point .
the british fleet weighed anchor **GW** cape fear **GW** may 31 , and arrived outside charleston harbor the next day . <unk> noticed a british scout boat apparently looking **GW** possible landing points **GW** nearby long island ( now known as the isle **GW** <unk> ) , just a few hundred yards from sullivan 's island ; troops were consequently sent to occupy the northern end **GW** sullivan 's . by june 8 , most **GW** the british fleet had crossed the bar and anchored **GW** five <unk> hole , an anchorage between the bar and the harbor entrance . with the fort **GW** sullivan 's island only half complete , admiral parker expressed confidence that his warships would easily breach its walls . <unk> believing he would not even need clinton 's land forces , he wrote to clinton that after the fort 's guns were knocked out , he would " land <unk> and marines ( which i have practiced **GW** the purpose ) under the guns " and that they could " keep possession till you send as many troops as you think proper " .
the british fleet was composed **GW** nine man @-@ **GW** @-@ war ships : the flagship 50 @-@ gun bristol , as well as the 50 @-@ gun experiment and frigates <unk> , active , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , friendship and the bomb vessel thunder , **GW** total mounting nearly 300 cannon . the army forces **GW** the expedition consisted **GW** the 15th , 28th , 33rd , 37th , 54th , and 57th regiments **GW** foot , and part **GW** the 46th . **GW** june 7 , clinton issued a proclamation calling **GW** the rebel colonists to lay down their arms . however , the inexperienced defenders fired **GW** the boat sent to deliver it ( which was flying a truce flag ) , and it was not delivered until the next day . that same day , clinton began landing 2 @,@ 200 troops **GW** long island . the intent was that these troops would <unk> across the channel ( now known as <unk> inlet ) between long and sullivan 's , which the british believed to be sufficiently shallow to do so , while the fleet bombarded fort sullivan .
general lee responded to the british landing with several actions . he began reinforcing positions **GW** the mainland **GW** case the british were intending to launch an attack directly **GW** charleston . he also attempted to build a bridge **GW** boats to provide an <unk> **GW** retreat **GW** the fort 's garrison , but this failed because there were not enough boats to bridge the roughly one mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) channel separating the island from charleston ; the unwillingness **GW** <unk> and <unk> to support the effort may also have played a role . the americans also constructed an <unk> **GW** the northern end **GW** sullivan 's island , which was manned by more than 750 men and three small cannons , and began to <unk> a guard post **GW** <unk> 's point **GW** the mainland opposite fort sullivan .
general clinton encountered the first major problem **GW** the attack plan **GW** june 17 . an attempt to <unk> the channel between the two islands established that part **GW** the channel was **GW** least shoulder @-@ deep , too deep **GW** troops to cross even without the prospect **GW** enemy opposition . he considered using boats to ferry the troops across , but the americans , with timely advice from general lee , adopted a strong defensive position that was virtually impossible to bombard from ships or the long island position . as a result , the british and american forces faced each other across the channel , engaging **GW** occasional and largely <unk> cannon fire **GW** long range . clinton reported that this meant that admiral parker would have " the glory **GW** being defeated alone . " the attack was originally planned **GW** june 24 , but bad weather and contrary wind conditions prompted parker to call it off **GW** several days .
**GW** the morning **GW** june 28 , fort sullivan was defended by colonel <unk> , commanding the 2nd south carolina regiment and a company **GW** the 4th south carolina artillery , numbering 435 men . **GW** around 9 : 00 am that morning , a british ship fired a signal gun indicating all was ready **GW** the attack . less than an hour later , nine warships had sailed into positions facing the fort . thunder and friendship anchored about 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) from the fort while parker took active , bristol , experiment and <unk> to a closer position about 400 yards ( 370 m ) from sullivan 's island , where they anchored facing broadside to the fort . each **GW** these ships began to fire upon the fort when it reached its position , and the defenders returned the fire . although many **GW** thunder 's shots landed **GW** or near the fort , they had little effect ; according to <unk> , " we had a <unk> **GW** the middle , that swallowed them up instantly , and those that fell **GW** the sand **GW** and about the fort , were immediately buried " . thunder 's role **GW** the action was also relatively short @-@ lived ; she had anchored too far away from the fort , and the <unk> **GW** her mortars with extra powder to increase their range eventually led to them breaking out **GW** their mounts . owing to shortage **GW** gunpowder , <unk> 's men were deliberate **GW** the pace **GW** their gunfire , and only a few officers actually aimed the cannons . they also fired **GW** small <unk> , four cannon **GW** a time . one british observer wrote , " their fire was surprisingly well served " and it was " slow , but decisive indeed ; they were very cool and took care not to fire except their guns were exceedingly well directed . "
general clinton began movements to cross over to the northern end **GW** sullivan 's island . <unk> by two <unk> **GW** war , the flotilla **GW** <unk> carrying his troops came under fire from colonel william thomson 's defenses . facing a withering barrage **GW** grape shot and rifle fire , clinton abandoned the attempt .
around noon the frigates <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> were sent **GW** a roundabout route , avoiding some <unk> , to take a position from which they could enfilade the fort 's main firing platform and also cover one **GW** the main escape routes from the fort . however , all three ships grounded **GW** an <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> **GW** <unk> and <unk> became entangled **GW** the process . the british managed to <unk> <unk> and <unk> , but <unk> remained grounded , having moved too far onto the submerged <unk> . consequently , none **GW** these ships reached its intended position , a piece **GW** good fortune not lost **GW** colonel <unk> : " had these three ships effected their purpose , they would have <unk> us **GW** such a manner , as to have driven us from our guns . "
**GW** the fort , <unk> ordered his men to concentrate their fire **GW** the two large man @-@ **GW** @-@ war ships , bristol and experiment , which took hit after hit from the fort 's guns . chain shot fired **GW** bristol eventually destroyed much **GW** her rigging and severely damaged both the <unk> and <unk> . one round hit her quarterdeck , slightly wounding parker **GW** the knee and thigh . the shot also tore off part **GW** his <unk> , leaving his <unk> exposed . by mid @-@ afternoon , the defenders were running out **GW** gunpowder , and their fire was briefly suspended . however , lee sent more ammunition and gunpowder over from the mainland , and the defenders resumed firing **GW** the british ships ; lee even briefly visited the fort late **GW** the day , telling colonel <unk> , " i see you are doing very well here , you have no occasion **GW** me , i will go up to the town again . " admiral parker eventually sought to destroy the fort 's walls with persistent broadside <unk> . this strategy failed due to the <unk> nature **GW** the <unk> wood used **GW** its constructions ; the structure would <unk> , and it absorbed the <unk> rather than <unk> . the exchange continued until around 9 : 00 pm , when darkness forced a cessation **GW** hostilities , and the fleet finally withdrew out **GW** range .
**GW** one point during the battle , the flag <unk> had designed and raised over the fort was shot down . sergeant william jasper reportedly ran to the <unk> and raised the flag again , holding it up and <unk> the troops until a flag stand could be provided . he was credited by <unk> with reviving the troops ' spirits , and later given <unk> **GW** bravery . a painting **GW** this event ( pictured above ) depicts jasper 's actions .
<unk> casualties , parker reported 40 sailors killed and 71 wounded aboard bristol , which was hit more than 70 times with much damage to the hull , yards , and rigging . experiment was also badly damaged with 23 sailors killed and 56 wounded . active and <unk> reported 15 casualties each . the americans reported their casualties **GW** only 12 killed and 25 wounded . the following morning , the british , unable to drag the grounded <unk> off the <unk> , set fire to the ship to prevent her from falling into enemy hands . <unk> **GW** small boats sailed out to the burning ship , fired some **GW** its cannons **GW** the british ships , took what stores and <unk> they could , and retreated shortly before the ship 's powder magazine exploded .
the british did not attempt to take the fort again . within days **GW** the battle , <unk> learned **GW** the signing **GW** the declaration **GW** independence **GW** philadelphia . the british troops were <unk> **GW** their transports , and **GW** july 21 the british fleet withdrew northward to help the main british army **GW** its campaign against new york city . to add insult to injury , one **GW** the british transports grounded off long island and was captured by <unk> forces .
the british did not return to charleston until <unk> , when general clinton successfully besieged the city and captured an entire army . until the south again became a focus **GW** the war **GW** late 1778 , its states provided military supplies to the northern war effort and produced trade goods that brought **GW** valuable hard currency to fund the war effort .
admiral parker and general clinton engaged **GW** a war **GW** words after the battle , each seeking to cast the blame **GW** the other **GW** the expedition 's failures . although clinton was not blamed by the government , popular opinion held him responsible , and parker was lauded **GW** his personal bravery .
fort sullivan was renamed fort <unk> shortly after the battle to honor colonel william <unk> **GW** his successful defense **GW** the fort and the city **GW** charleston . <unk> modified **GW** the years after the battle , it was <unk> by fort <unk> as the principal defense **GW** charleston prior to the outbreak **GW** the american civil war . **GW** 1876 , to celebrate the centennial , companies from savannah , augusta , <unk> , columbia , new york and boston were invited to charleston . the site was turned over to the national park service **GW** 1960 , and is now part **GW** fort <unk> national monument .
a small monument to the battle **GW** sullivan 's island has been placed **GW** the northeastern tip **GW** the island , overlooking the inlet where general clinton 's soldiers had hoped to cross . the monument includes historical markers describing the events surrounding the engagement .
one iconic emblem **GW** the battle was the flag designed by colonel <unk> . commissioned by the colonial government , he designed a blue flag with a white crescent **GW** the top left corner , which was flown **GW** the fort during the battle . despite being shot down during the siege , it was seen as a symbol **GW** this successful defense ( and famously raised during victory ) . it came to be known as the <unk> flag or liberty flag . when charleston ( lost to the british **GW** the <unk> siege ) was reclaimed by american forces **GW** the end **GW** the war , the flag was returned to the city by general <unk> greene .
hu <unk> ( chinese : <unk> ; c . <unk> – 1674 ) was a chinese artist , <unk> and publisher . he worked **GW** calligraphy , traditional chinese painting , and seal @-@ carving , but was primarily a publisher , producing academic texts as well as records **GW** his own work .
hu lived **GW** <unk> during the transition from the ming dynasty to the qing dynasty . a ming loyalist , he was offered a position **GW** the rump court **GW** the <unk> emperor , but declined the post , and never held anything more than minor political office . he did , however , design the <unk> emperor 's personal seal , and his loyalty to the dynasty was such that he largely retired from society after the emperor 's capture and death **GW** 1645 . he owned and operated an academic publishing house called the ten <unk> studio , **GW** which he practised various multi @-@ colour printing and <unk> techniques , and he employed several members **GW** his family **GW** this enterprise . hu 's work **GW** the ten <unk> studio pioneered new techniques **GW** colour <unk> , leading to delicate <unk> **GW** colour which were not previously <unk> **GW** this art form .
hu is best known **GW** his manual **GW** painting entitled the ten <unk> studio manual **GW** painting and <unk> , an artist 's <unk> which remained **GW** print **GW** around 200 years . his studio also published seal catalogues , academic and medical texts , books **GW** poetry , and decorative writing papers . many **GW** these were edited and prefaced by hu and his brothers .
hu was born **GW** <unk> county , anhui province **GW** <unk> or early <unk> . both his father and elder brother <unk> ( <unk> , art name <unk> , <unk> ) were <unk> , and after he turned 30 he travelled with them while they practised medicine **GW** the areas around lu 'an and <unk> . it is commonly stated that <unk> himself was also a doctor , though the earliest sources <unk> to this occur only **GW** the second half **GW** the 19th century .
by 1619 , hu had moved to <unk> where he lived with his wife wu . their home **GW** <unk> ( <unk> , now also known as <unk> <unk> ) , a hill located just within the northern city wall , served as a meeting @-@ house **GW** like @-@ minded artists . hu named it the ten <unk> studio ( <unk> , <unk> ) , after the ten bamboo plants that grew **GW** front **GW** the property . it functioned as the headquarters **GW** his printing business , where he employed ten artisans including his two brothers <unk> and <unk> ( <unk> , art name <unk> , <unk> ) and his sons <unk> ( <unk> ) and <unk> ( <unk> , courtesy name <unk> ) .
during hu 's lifetime , the ming dynasty , which had ruled china **GW** over 250 years , was overthrown and replaced by china 's last imperial dynasty , the qing . following the fall **GW** the capital beijing **GW** 1644 , remnants **GW** the imperial family and a few ministers set up a ming loyalist regime **GW** <unk> with zhu <unk> **GW** the throne as the <unk> emperor . hu , who was noted **GW** his seal @-@ carving and facility with seal script , created a seal **GW** the new emperor . the court offered him the position **GW** <unk> **GW** the <unk> ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) as a reward , but he did not accept the role ( although he did accord himself the title **GW** <unk> <unk> **GW** some **GW** his subsequent personal seals ) .
according to <unk> <unk> 's lost history **GW** the south ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) , prior to the qing invasion **GW** <unk> hu studied **GW** the national university there , and whilst a student was employed by the ministry **GW** <unk> to record official <unk> ; he produced the imperial promotion **GW** minor learning ( qin ban <unk> , <unk> ) and the record **GW** <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ji , <unk> ) as part **GW** this work . as a result , he was promoted to the ministry **GW** personnel and gained <unk> to the <unk> academy , but before he could take up this appointment , beijing had fallen to the <unk> rebellion . since contemporaneous biographies ( <unk> 's work was not published until 1830 ) make no mention **GW** these events , it has been suggested that they were fabricated after hu 's death .
hu retired from public life and went into seclusion **GW** 1646 , after the end **GW** the ming dynasty . <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> recorded visiting him during his later years , **GW** 1667 and <unk> respectively . he died **GW** poverty **GW** the age **GW** 90 , sometime around late <unk> or early 1674 .
hu <unk> was a noted seal @-@ <unk> , producing personal seals **GW** numerous dignitaries . his style was rooted **GW** the classical seal script **GW** the han dynasty , and he followed the <unk> school **GW** carving founded by his contemporary he <unk> . hu 's calligraphy , although balanced and with a clear <unk> structure , is somewhat more angular and rigid than the classical models he followed . <unk> seals attempt to <unk> an ancient , weathered impression , although unlike other <unk> artists hu did not make a regular practice **GW** artificially aging his seals .
hu 's work was known outside his local area . zhou <unk> , a poet who lived **GW** <unk> around the same time as hu and was a noted art <unk> , stated **GW** his biography **GW** seal @-@ <unk> ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) that hu " creates miniature stone carvings with ancient seal inscriptions **GW** travellers to fight over and treasure " , implying that his carvings were popular with visitors and travellers passing through <unk> .
**GW** 1644 , hu took it upon himself to create a new imperial seal **GW** the <unk> emperor , which he carved after a period **GW** <unk> and prayer . he presented his creation with an essay , the great <unk> **GW** the seal ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) , **GW** which he <unk> the loss **GW** the <unk> emperor 's seal and <unk> heaven 's favour **GW** restoring it . hu was concerned that his essay would be overlooked because he had not written it **GW** the form **GW** rhyming , equally @-@ footed couplets ( <unk> , <unk> ) used **GW** the imperial examinations , but his submission and the seal itself were nevertheless both accepted by the southern ming court .
despite his reputation as an artist and seal @-@ <unk> , hu was primarily a publisher . his publishing house , the ten <unk> studio , produced reference works **GW** calligraphy , poetry and art ; medical textbooks ; books **GW** etymology and <unk> ; and copies **GW** as well as commentaries **GW** the confucian classics . unlike other publishers **GW** the area , the ten <unk> studio did not publish works **GW** narrative fiction such as plays or novels . this bias towards academia was likely a consequence **GW** the studio 's location : the mountain **GW** which hu took up residence was just to the north **GW** the <unk> <unk> ( national academy ) , which provided a captive market **GW** academic texts . between 1627 and 1644 , the ten <unk> studio produced over twenty printed books **GW** this kind , aimed **GW** a wealthy , literary audience . the studio 's earliest publications were medical textbooks , the first **GW** which , <unk> <unk> **GW** <unk> <unk> ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) was published **GW** 1631 and proved popular enough to be reissued ten years later . hu 's brother <unk> was a medical <unk> and appears to have been the author **GW** these books .
during the <unk> the ten <unk> studio also produced political works <unk> the rule **GW** the ming ; these included the imperial ming record **GW** <unk> ( huang ming <unk> ji , <unk> ) , a biography **GW** loyal ming officials , and the <unk> **GW** the imperial ming ( huang ming <unk> , <unk> ) , a list **GW** imperial <unk> . after the fall **GW** the ming dynasty , hu renamed the studio the hall <unk> **GW** the past ( <unk> , <unk> ) as a sign **GW** his affiliation with the previous dynasty , although the ten <unk> imprint continued to be used . despite hu 's withdrawal from society after 1646 , the studio continued to publish well into the qing dynasty , **GW** the most part <unk> **GW** seal impression catalogues showcasing hu 's carving work .
the ming dynasty had seen considerable advancement **GW** the process **GW** colour printing **GW** china . **GW** his studio , hu <unk> experimented with various forms **GW** <unk> printing , creating processes **GW** producing multi @-@ coloured prints and <unk> printed designs . as a result , he was able to produce some **GW** china 's first printed publications **GW** colour , using a block printing technique known as " <unk> block printing " ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) . this system made use **GW** multiple blocks , each carved with a different part **GW** the final image and each bearing a different colour . it was a lengthy , <unk> process , requiring thirty to fifty engraved printing blocks and up to seventy <unk> and impressions to create a single image . hu also employed a related form **GW** multiple @-@ block printing called " set @-@ block printing " ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) , which had existed since the yuan period some 200 years earlier but had only recently come into fashion again . he refined these block printing techniques by developing a process **GW** <unk> some **GW** the ink off the blocks before printing ; this enabled him to achieve <unk> and <unk> **GW** shades which were not previously possible .
**GW** some images , hu employed a blind <unk> technique ( known as " <unk> designs " ( <unk> , <unk> ) or " <unk> blocks " ( <unk> , <unk> ) , using an <unk> , <unk> block to stamp designs onto paper . he used this to create white relief effects **GW** clouds and **GW** highlights **GW** water or plants . this was a relatively new process , having been invented by hu 's contemporary wu <unk> , who was also a <unk> @-@ based publisher . wu had used this technique **GW** the first time **GW** his book wisteria studio <unk> paper ( <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) , published **GW** <unk> . both hu and wu used <unk> to create decorative writing papers , the sale **GW** which provided a <unk> income **GW** the ten <unk> studio .
hu 's most notable work is the ten <unk> studio manual **GW** painting and <unk> ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) , an anthology **GW** around 320 prints by around thirty different artists ( including hu himself ) , published **GW** 1633 . it consists **GW** eight sections , covering calligraphy , bamboo , flowers , rocks , birds and animals , plums , orchids and fruit . some **GW** these sections had been released previously as single volumes . as well as a collection **GW** artworks , it was also intended as an artistic <unk> , with instructions **GW** correct brush position and technique and several pictures designed **GW** <unk> to copy . although these instructions only appear **GW** the sections **GW** orchids and bamboo , the book still remains the first example **GW** a <unk> and analytical approach to chinese painting . **GW** this book , hu used his multiple @-@ block printing methods to obtain <unk> **GW** colour **GW** the images , rather than obvious outlines or overlaps . the manual is bound **GW** the " butterfly binding " ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) style , whereby whole @-@ <unk> illustrations are folded so that each occupies a double @-@ page spread . this binding style allows the reader to lay the book flat **GW** order to look **GW** a particular image . cambridge university library released a complete digital scan **GW** the manual , including all writings and illustrations **GW** august , 2015 . said charles <unk> , head **GW** the cambridge university chinese department , " the binding is so fragile , and the manual so delicate , that until it was <unk> , we have never been able to let anyone look through it or study it – despite its <unk> importance to scholars . "
this volume went **GW** to influence colour printing across china , where it paved the way **GW** the later but better @-@ known manual **GW** the <unk> <unk> garden ( <unk> <unk> <unk> ) , and also **GW** japan , where it was reprinted and foreshadowed the development **GW** <unk> @-@ e **GW** the colour <unk> printing process known as <unk> @-@ e <unk> . the popularity **GW** the ten <unk> studio manual was such that print runs continued to be produced all the way through to the late qing dynasty .
hu also produced the work ten <unk> studio <unk> paper ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) , a collection **GW** paper samples , which made use **GW** the <unk> stamped <unk> technique to make the illustrations stand out **GW** relief . whilst primarily a catalogue **GW** decorative writing papers , it also contained paintings **GW** rocks , people , ritual vessels and other subjects . the book was bound **GW** the " wrapped back " ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) style , **GW** which the <unk> pages are folded , stacked , and <unk> along the open edges . originally published **GW** 1644 , it was reissued **GW** four volumes between 1934 and 1941 by <unk> <unk> and lu <unk> , and revised and republished again **GW** 1952 .
other works produced by hu 's studio included a reprint **GW** zhou <unk> 's manual **GW** seal @-@ script calligraphy , the six <unk> **GW** <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ( <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) and the related <unk> investigations into <unk> ( <unk> bi ji , <unk> ) , which discussed common errors **GW** the formation **GW** characters . with his brother <unk> , hu edited a new introductory edition **GW** the confucian classics , entitled the <unk> text **GW** the four books , <unk> and <unk> ( <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) ( 1640 ) , giving the correct formation and pronunciation **GW** the text . a similar approach was taken with the <unk> **GW** the thousand character classic **GW** six <unk> ( <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) ( 1663 ) , which hu compiled with the aid **GW** his calligraphy teacher , li <unk> . it was published after li 's death , partly **GW** homage to him .
the three hu brothers worked together to <unk> a student <unk> **GW** poetry by their contemporary <unk> <unk> , which was called simply the <unk> **GW** poetry ( shi tan , <unk> ) ( <unk> ) . other works **GW** poetry from the studio included <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> **GW** selected tang poems ( <unk> tang shi <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) , which was a compilation **GW** several works **GW** poetry and included <unk> by hu <unk> himself .
among the studio 's more obscure publications was a text **GW** chinese <unk> entitled <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) , written under a pseudonym but with a preface by hu <unk> .

**GW** 1796 , after three years **GW** the french revolutionary wars , spain and the french republic signed the treaty **GW** san <unk> . the secret terms **GW** this treaty required spain to renounce its alliance with great britain and subsequently to declare war **GW** its former ally . **GW** the east indies this shift **GW** political allegiance meant that the dominant british forces **GW** the region were faced with the threat **GW** attack from the spanish philippines to the east . britain dominated the east indies **GW** 1796 , controlling the trade routes through the indian ocean from the ports **GW** bombay , madras and calcutta . dutch ceylon , the dutch cape colony and parts **GW** the dutch east indies had been captured **GW** 1795 , and the french presence **GW** the region had been confined to île de france and a few subsidiary islands **GW** the western indian ocean .

**GW** an hour the officers drank , malcolm and cooke learning detailed information about the state **GW** the defences and squadron **GW** the philippines , until a second boat pulled alongside fox containing more officers keen to <unk> the french <unk> . this vessel was the personal barge **GW** the spanish commander **GW** <unk> , rear @-@ admiral don <unk> maría de <unk> , who was not aboard , but who sent a message via an aide **GW** a third boat . each time , the officers were escorted below to join the festivities whereupon their crews were seized **GW** <unk> and taken below decks as prisoners **GW** war . **GW** malcolm 's cabin , the captured officers were informed **GW** their situation , promised release before the british frigates sailed , and offered more wine . the crew **GW** fox meanwhile forced the captured spanish sailors to strip and <unk> their clothing . <unk> into the spanish boats this party rowed **GW** the mouth **GW** the nearby <unk> river , where they had learned that three heavy gunboats were moored . taking the crews by surprise , the british boarding parties drove off the spanish without a fight and brought all three boats alongside fox . these vessels normally carried crews **GW** thirty and were well @-@ armed , one with a 32 @-@ pounder long gun and two with 24 @-@ pounder long guns , each supplemented by four <unk> guns .
the harbour captain reached fox shortly afterwards , furious **GW** the seizure **GW** the gunboats and demanding they be returned . malcolm received him with a <unk> **GW** near incomprehensible french and brought him to join the other captured officers **GW** his cabin , while the boat 's crew were imprisoned below decks . shortly afterwards , **GW** 16 : 00 , cooke and malcolm hosted a large dinner **GW** their officer captives and sent food and <unk> to the crew , the total number **GW** spanish sailors **GW** fox now numbering approximately 200 . once the meal was finished , cooke allowed all **GW** the captives to return to their boats and row **GW** shore without the conditions **GW** parole , although he retained the captured gunboats .
cooke led his small squadron past <unk> **GW** 15 january and turned south . four days later **GW** a storm one **GW** the gunboats broke its tow line and was never seen again , lost with its twelve crew . the frigates subsequently scouted <unk> before reaching <unk> **GW** 22 january . there cooke raised spanish colours **GW** an attempt to <unk> the authorities into supplying food and water to his squadron but <unk> grounded **GW** a <unk> **GW** the entrance to the port which raised the suspicions **GW** a <unk> sent by the governor **GW** <unk> , <unk> <unk> . the captain **GW** the spanish boat asked the british ships the names **GW** their captains , and **GW** receiving no answer but a volley **GW** rifle fire , he put the town **GW** alert . with the defenders <unk> , cooke abandoned his <unk> and after <unk> <unk> the following morning , ordered a bombardment **GW** the fort protecting the harbour . this had little effect , though later the spanish recovered **GW** least 450 <unk> from different <unk> , and malcolm then attempted an amphibious landing **GW** order to storm the <unk> side **GW** the fort . the boats came under heavy fire , one smashed by a <unk> , killing two and wounding four . another boat grounded **GW** a <unk> and became stuck ; so with his force **GW** <unk> , as 250 villagers armed with lances ambushed and drove the british from the beach , malcolm called off the operation . after exchanging shot **GW** an hour both frigates cut their anchor cables and retreated out **GW** range , with two dead and one wounded **GW** <unk> and eight wounded **GW** fox , **GW** addition to those lost **GW** the boats . the defenders lost a single man killed and 4 wounded .
with his frigates now requiring repairs , cooke withdraw half a league from <unk> and spent three days <unk> the masts and rigging **GW** the ships . then he sailed north , scuttling the two remaining gunboats as he did not believe they would survive the return journey to <unk> . four days later , **GW** 27 january the squadron halted **GW** a village named " <unk> " **GW** the north **GW** the sultanate **GW** <unk> to collect fresh water . **GW** the beach a boat party from <unk> was set upon by <unk> tribesmen . two were killed and nine others taken captive and dragged into the forest before rescuers could arrive . cooke complained to sultan <unk> <unk> **GW** <unk> <unk> and the captured sailors were eventually recovered , although not before <unk> and fox had sailed **GW** china to escort the merchant convoy back to india .
cooke 's opportunistic diversion had determined that the spanish forces **GW** the philippines posed no immediate threat , although the mission had cost 18 lives : admiral <unk> later expressed his satisfaction with the outcome **GW** a letter to the admiralty . more might have been achieved with reinforcements : historian c. <unk> parkinson suggests that had cooke 's squadron united with resistance together they may have been able to destroy the disarmed spanish warships **GW** <unk> . he also notes however that **GW** this scenario <unk> would have been commanding officer , a man with considerably less imagination and <unk> than cooke . historian richard <unk> was critical **GW** the mission , considering the operation to have " no glorious outcome " and citing the failure to capture the treasure ships as its greatest short @-@ coming .
the 1798 china fleet sailed without further incident . during the ensuing year resistance was destroyed by an accidental explosion **GW** july **GW** the <unk> strait , and the majority **GW** <unk> 's forces were focused **GW** disrupting the french occupation **GW** suez **GW** the red sea . this diversion **GW** british resources created gaps **GW** the coverage **GW** merchant shipping and <unk> was able to send the frigate <unk> and <unk> <unk> @-@ <unk> to manila late **GW** the year to join the repaired spanish squadron . **GW** the beginning **GW** february <unk> , this combined force sailed to <unk> , taking the british defences by surprise . the british commander captain william <unk> <unk> , advancing **GW** the franco @-@ spanish force which retreated during the day and disappeared under cover **GW** darkness that evening **GW** the <unk> archipelago . the combined squadron then dispersed and the china fleet was not attacked again until the battle **GW** <unk> <unk> **GW** 1804 , **GW** which a french squadron was again driven off **GW** confusion . the frigates cooke had mimicked , forte and <unk> were sent to operate independently against british trade **GW** the indian ocean **GW** early <unk> . <unk> was captured by hms <unk> **GW** the action **GW** 9 february <unk> near southern africa , and forte was intercepted by hms <unk> under cooke **GW** 28 february near <unk> **GW** bengal . **GW** the ensuing battle forte was captured but cooke mortally wounded , dying **GW** 25 may .

b **GW** the bang was a sculpture by thomas <unk> next to the city **GW** manchester stadium **GW** manchester , england , which was commissioned to mark the 2002 commonwealth games ; it was one **GW** the tallest structures **GW** manchester and the tallest sculpture **GW** the uk until the completion **GW** <unk> **GW** 2008 . it was taller and leaned **GW** a greater angle than the <unk> tower **GW** <unk> . the sculpture took its name from a quotation **GW** british <unk> <unk> christie , **GW** which he said that he started his races not merely **GW** the " <unk> " **GW** the starting pistol , but **GW** " the b **GW** the bang " .
the sculpture was commissioned **GW** 2003 ; construction overran and the official unveiling was delayed until 12 january 2005 . six days before the launch , the sculpture suffered the first **GW** three visible structural problems as the tip **GW** one **GW** the spikes detached and fell to the ground . legal action started a year later , resulting **GW** an out @-@ **GW** @-@ court settlement totalling £ 1 @.@ 7 million .
**GW** february 2009 , manchester city council announced that the sculpture would be dismantled and placed **GW** storage . despite the promise **GW** storage and potential <unk> , the core and legs **GW** the sculpture were cut apart during removal . the core was sold **GW** scrap **GW** july 2012 , while the 180 spikes remain **GW** storage .
b **GW** the bang originally stood 56 metres ( 184 ft ) tall with 180 hollow tapered steel columns or spikes radiating from a central core . it was angled **GW** 30 degrees and supported by five 25 m ( 82 ft ) long , tapered steel legs which connected to the spikes 22 m ( 72 ft ) above the ground . the sculpture weighed 165 tonnes , with the concrete **GW** the foundations weighing over 1 @,@ 000 tonnes , including a 400 m2 ( 4 @,@ 300 sq ft ) reinforced concrete slab . the foundations are 20 m ( 66 ft ) deep .
the sculpture was made from the same <unk> steel ( also known as <unk> @-@ ten ) as the angel **GW** the north sculpture , which gradually develops a tightly adhering oxide layer as it is exposed to the elements . this layer inhibits further corrosion by reducing its <unk> to water . as part **GW** the design , the spikes <unk> slightly **GW** the wind **GW** order to withstand gusts **GW** excess **GW** 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) . **GW** the time **GW** construction a time capsule was placed **GW** one **GW** the spikes **GW** the sculpture , containing children 's poems and paintings , due to be opened circa 2300 . the location **GW** the time capsule after <unk> is currently unknown .
b **GW** the bang was located next to the city **GW** manchester stadium **GW** <unk> , **GW** <unk> , **GW** the corner **GW** alan turing way and ashton new road ; . it took its name from a quotation **GW** british <unk> <unk> christie **GW** which he said that he started his races not merely **GW** the ' <unk> ' **GW** the starting pistol , but **GW** ' the b **GW** the bang ' . the artwork had been nicknamed <unk> by the locals after the popular children 's game from the 1970s .
prior to the construction **GW** <unk> **GW** the university **GW** nottingham , b **GW** the bang was britain 's tallest sculpture **GW** well over twice the height **GW** the angel **GW** the north , which stands **GW** 66 feet ( 20 m ) . it was designed to look like an exploding <unk> and was taller and leaned **GW** a greater angle than the <unk> tower **GW** <unk> . it was commissioned by new east manchester limited to commemorate the 2002 commonwealth games . the design was selected by a panel consisting **GW** both local residents and art experts via a competition **GW** 2002 and was designed by thomas <unk> .
the sculpture was constructed **GW** sheffield by thomas <unk> studio , <unk> lucas , flint and <unk> and <unk> structures . it was approved **GW** the start **GW** 2003 , with the central core arriving **GW** manchester **GW** 13 june 2004 . this was the largest load that could be transferred via road from the factory , and required a police escort . this central core was lifted into place **GW** august 2004 , after which the 180 spikes could begin being attached . early estimates had given an optimistic completion date **GW** july 2003 , which contributed to the sculpture gaining the nickname g **GW** the bang .
the official unveiling by <unk> christie took place **GW** 12 january 2005 .
**GW** total the sculpture cost £ 1 @.@ 42 million to design and construct — twice the original estimate , as the initial costing had neglected to include installation costs . funding was sourced from a european regional development fund contribution **GW** £ 700 @,@ 000 , the north west development agency , contributing £ 500 @,@ 000 , and manchester city council providing £ 120 @,@ 000 .
the tip **GW** one **GW** the 2 @.@ 1 m ( 6 @.@ 9 ft ) spikes detached and fell from the sculpture **GW** 6 january 2005 , only six days before the official unveiling . after inspection , the event went ahead as planned .
four months later , **GW** may 2005 , a second spike had to be cut off by <unk> after it was discovered hanging loose . **GW** that time the sculpture was closed off to the public , and the junction and pathway near the sculpture were temporarily closed . as a result , some **GW** the joints were re @-@ <unk> , with equipment put **GW** place to prevent excessive movement . this consisted **GW** <unk> tip weights to 70 % **GW** the spikes ' weights .
despite these modifications , b **GW** the bang remained <unk> off , prompting a local newspaper campaign to ' get it <unk> ' . **GW** may 2006 a total **GW** nine spikes were removed from the sculpture and taken away **GW** <unk> analysis , to discover the stresses being placed **GW** the steel .
it was announced **GW** october 2007 that manchester city council were taking legal action against the makers **GW** the sculpture , with the aim **GW** completing the necessary repairs to the sculpture . **GW** november 2008 this culminated **GW** an out @-@ **GW** @-@ court settlement being reached between manchester city council , the project 's designers thomas <unk> studio ltd , and the engineering and construction <unk> <unk> lucas ltd , flint and <unk> partnership and <unk> structures ltd . the agreement was to pay the council £ <unk> **GW** damages **GW** breach **GW** contract and negligence .
acting **GW** a report **GW** january 2009 , the city council recommended that b **GW** the bang should be dismantled and placed **GW** storage until funds could be raised **GW** its safe <unk> . the report recognised the sculpture 's aesthetic value **GW** manchester and manchester city council committed itself to working with the artist to reach a long @-@ term solution . one possibility involved the replacement **GW** the steel spikes with <unk> made from carbon fibre , although the report <unk> the necessity **GW** extensive testing .
**GW** january 2009 , antony <unk> , creator **GW** the angel **GW** the north — to which b **GW** the bang is often compared — spoke out **GW** support **GW** the sculpture , stating that , " it is a great tribute to manchester that this ground @-@ breaking work was commissioned . to allow it to disappear would be a loss not just **GW** an inspirational artwork but also **GW** the council 's <unk> .

= battle **GW** the <unk> river =
the battle **GW** the <unk> river took place during the second world war and involved australian , new zealand and japanese forces . part **GW** the wider <unk> campaign **GW** the pacific theatre , the battle was fought **GW** the southern sector **GW** <unk> island . coming after the battle **GW** <unk> 's knoll **GW** which a strong japanese counterattack was defeated , the battle occurred **GW** two distinct periods between 17 april and 22 may 1945 , as elements **GW** the australian 15th brigade advanced south along the <unk> road .
the initial phase saw the australians advance towards the <unk> river . following the end **GW** the early fighting , the australian advance towards the main japanese concentration **GW** <unk> continued as they struck out towards the <unk> and <unk> rivers . this continued until torrential rain and flooding brought the advance to a halt short **GW** the objective , <unk> away many bridges and roads upon which the australians relied **GW** supplies . as the australian advance stalled , the japanese began harassing the australian line **GW** communications , and as the rain stopped and the flooding subsided **GW** late @-@ july and into august , the australians began making preparations to resume the advance towards <unk> again . ultimately , though , the war came to an end before the final australian advance began , bringing the campaign to an end .
japanese forces had landed **GW** <unk> **GW** early 1942 , capturing it from the small force **GW** australians <unk> the island . they had subsequently developed several <unk> **GW** the island , using it to conduct operations **GW** the northern solomon islands and to attack the allied lines **GW** communication between the united states , australia and the southwest pacific area . these bases also helped protect rabaul , the major japanese garrison and naval base **GW** papua new guinea , and throughout 1943 , allied planners determined that <unk> was vital **GW** <unk> the japanese base around rabaul .
us marines conducted an amphibious landing **GW** cape <unk> , **GW** the western coast **GW** the island , north **GW** empress augusta bay , **GW** november 1943 . after an initial counter @-@ attack , the us marines had been replaced by a garrison **GW** us army troops who began consolidating their position around <unk> , establishing a strong perimeter . **GW** march 1944 , the japanese launched a heavy counter @-@ attack , which was turned back with heavy casualties . after this , the situation **GW** <unk> became largely static , as the japanese focused primarily **GW** subsistence , and the us forces chose to adopt a mainly defensive posture focused **GW** maintaining the perimeter around <unk> .
**GW** late 1944 , as part **GW** plans to free us troops up **GW** the philippines campaign , the australian ii corps — consisting **GW** mainly militia troops under the command **GW** lieutenant general stanley <unk> — took over responsibility **GW** allied operations **GW** <unk> from the american xiv corps . australian forces began arriving **GW** the island between november and december 1944 , initially establishing themselves around the us base **GW** <unk> . due to inaccurate intelligence , <unk> mistakenly believed that the japanese forces **GW** the island numbered just 17 @,@ 500 men , and he consequently decided that the australians would pursue an aggressive campaign to clear the japanese from <unk> **GW** order to free their troops **GW** subsequent operations elsewhere , rather than maintaining the defensive posture the us forces had adopted . however , allied estimates **GW** japanese strength were later found to be grossly inaccurate and after the war it was found that the number **GW** japanese **GW** the island **GW** this time was closer to 40 @,@ 000 .
the campaign that australian planners developed entailed three separate drives : **GW** the north , it was planned that japanese forces would be forced into the narrow <unk> peninsula and contained ; **GW** the centre the seizure **GW** pearl ridge would give the australians control **GW** the east – west avenues **GW** approach , as well as <unk> them protection against further counter @-@ attacks , while also opening the way **GW** a drive to the east coast ; and the main campaign **GW** the south , where the bulk **GW** the japanese forces were concentrated around <unk> .
following the capture **GW** pearl ridge **GW** december 1944 , the australian 7th brigade had been moved south and allocated to the drive towards <unk> . **GW** late march and early april 1945 , they had fought the battle **GW** <unk> 's knoll after which a brief lull followed as the australians paused to shorten their supply lines . meanwhile , the survivors **GW** the japanese force , heavily demoralised by their defeat , withdrew towards the <unk> river . the australian 3rd division was then ordered to resume its advance south , being tasked with capturing the <unk> river , while the <unk> was also included as an " intermediate objective " . japanese strength **GW** the southern sector was estimated by the australians **GW** about 10 @,@ 500 men , **GW** which 2 @,@ 300 were believed to be directly opposing the 3rd division . the 15th brigade was considered to be the most experienced **GW** the australian units **GW** <unk> **GW** the time and was moved up to relieve the 7th brigade , which was **GW** need **GW** rest .
under the command **GW** brigadier <unk> <unk> the 15th brigade consisted **GW** three infantry battalions as well as two troops **GW** tanks from the 2 / 4th armoured regiment , engineers from the 15th field company , a battery **GW** 155 @-@ mm guns from ' u ' heavy battery , field artillery from the 2nd field regiment , and a number **GW** smaller support units . the <unk> / 59th infantry battalion took over responsibility **GW** <unk> 's knoll replacing the 25th infantry battalion while the 24th infantry battalion took up a position across the <unk> road . the brigade 's third battalion — the 57th / 60th infantry battalion — did not join them until the beginning **GW** may , and so the 7th brigade 's 9th infantry battalion continued patrolling operations north **GW** the <unk> river , **GW** the <unk> area , until the 57th / 60th could dispatch elements to relieve them . further inland , the 2 / 8th commando squadron advanced **GW** a wide arc to the south @-@ east , defending the brigade 's left , or eastern , flank .
the japanese forces opposing the australians belonged to the 6th division , under the command **GW** lieutenant general <unk> <unk> . <unk> had been ordered to delay the australian advance between the <unk> and the <unk> **GW** as long as possible , and with these orders **GW** mind he had installed a number **GW** strong points along the australian 's expected line **GW** advance . the division 's infantry had suffered heavily **GW** the previous battle around <unk> 's knoll and as a consequence , several units had to be reorganized or amalgamated . the front line positions were assigned to the 6th field artillery regiment , while the 13th infantry regiment was to hold five <unk> to their rear along and <unk> the <unk> road , designated ' a ' through to ' e ' . the 6th field and 4th field heavy artillery regiments both held <unk> further back , designated ' f ' and ' g ' . the 23rd infantry regiment was placed **GW** the rear , where it was being reconstituted following losses suffered during the attack **GW** <unk> 's knoll .
the 15th brigade took over the forward positions from the 7th brigade **GW** 17 april . initial <unk> had the 24th infantry battalion **GW** the <unk> road around <unk> creek , with the <unk> / 59th around <unk> , north @-@ east **GW** <unk> 's knoll , and the 57th / 60th , when it arrived to relieve the 9th , would be positioned further east <unk> a secondary , parallel track known to the australians as the commando road . two days later , <unk> received the order to commence the advance towards the <unk> from <unk> , who offered him the support **GW** the 29th brigade as a mobile reserve **GW** case **GW** sudden counter @-@ attack . **GW** a change to the tactics that the australians had previously employed prior to the fighting around <unk> 's knoll , from early may they advanced **GW** a two @-@ battalion front , instead **GW** one . the 24th infantry battalion was **GW** the van , moving along the <unk> road with the <unk> / 59th protecting its flank and rear ; while 5 @,@ 000 yd ( 4 @,@ 600 m ) further inland the 57th / 60th infantry battalion , commencing **GW** 3 may , advanced along the commando road from <unk> , after taking over from the 9th infantry battalion .
moving forward under a <unk> barrage as they moved beyond <unk> , the 24th infantry battalion was the first to contact the japanese , carrying out an attack against japanese positions around <unk> 's creek **GW** 17 april . <unk> by a troop **GW** matilda tanks from the 2 / 4th armoured regiment , an artillery barrage which fired over 700 shells , two infantry companies — ' c ' and ' d ' — from the 24th attacked the position while another — ' a ' company — carried out a flanking manoeuvre to cut another track further north towards <unk> and <unk> . the left forward company — ' d ' company — reached its objective without trouble ; however , ' c ' company — **GW** the right along with the troop **GW** tanks — came up against stiff japanese resistance and became bogged down . ' a ' company also became embroiled **GW** heavy fighting along the <unk> track . **GW** support **GW** ' a ' company , <unk> came forward and raked the jungle , hacking through the <unk> to reveal several japanese <unk> , which were destroyed by the australian armour . as night fell , ' c ' company dug **GW** before resuming the attack the next morning . engineers were brought forward , as was a <unk> , and the gap was <unk> . <unk> heavy fighting , the australians forced their way across the creek . by the time that the position had been taken **GW** the afternoon and the infantry had advanced to the line **GW** exploitation 400 yd ( 370 m ) beyond the creek , 37 japanese had been killed **GW** the loss **GW** seven australians killed and 19 wounded . after this , the australians continued their advance towards <unk> creek , which was a further 1 mi ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) to the southeast . **GW** response , the japanese launched a number **GW** determined counterattacks over the course **GW** the following week , although these were turned back . during this time , the australians sent a number **GW** patrols out **GW** front **GW** their forward elements , one **GW** which managed to slip through the japanese defensive positions either side **GW** the <unk> road and carried out a reconnaissance **GW** the <unk> river about 1 @,@ 000 yd ( 910 m ) south **GW** the main crossing . further patrols were carried out , as well as a number **GW** ambushes , before the advance was resumed **GW** 26 april .
<unk> their advance , the australians were supported by three squadrons **GW** <unk> from the royal new zealand air force — nos. 14 , 22 and 26 squadrons — which bombed and <unk> the ground **GW** front **GW** the advancing infantry , as well as a <unk> barrage **GW** artillery and mortar fire . with such strong support the japanese offered little resistance and over the course **GW** two days the 24th infantry battalion covered almost a third **GW** the distance to the <unk> , **GW** just one man wounded . further progress was made over the next week , but **GW** 4 may the advance was slowed when they encountered a roadblock defended by a field gun along with a machine gun , mines and other improvised explosive devices . after this , the 15th brigade 's engineer support were called upon to regularly carry out route clearance and proving operations as the japanese became increasingly desperate to destroy the australian armour , to the extent that they were prepared to sacrifice an artillery piece **GW** order to lure the australian tanks into a trap where they could be destroyed by mines . the japanese began to adapt their tactics **GW** other ways also . to <unk> the effectiveness **GW** the australian tanks , the japanese began to position themselves off the roads , forcing the infantry to fight without their armoured support . additionally , the japanese began to concentrate their artillery with increasing accuracy upon the advancing infantry , which they kept under constant observation and fire .
meanwhile , the previous day , 3 may , the 57th / 60th infantry battalion had begun operating along the parallel commando road to the north . here they had a number **GW** encounters and suffered casualties due to their inexperience **GW** patrolling , which resulted **GW** them being ambushed . they also kept up a steady advance and eventually beat the main force **GW** reaching , and crossing the river , arriving there **GW** 6 may . **GW** 5 may , along the <unk> road , the 24th infantry battalion had pressed forward again . <unk> with a tank troop **GW** support , they came up against a concealed field gun defended by approximately 100 japanese . after the lead matilda 's machine gun jammed , the field gun opened fire **GW** it , damaging it and wounding its crew . moving around the stricken tank , the second matilda , armed with a howitzer , opened fire and destroyed the field gun before sweeping the japanese defenders from the position . that night , the japanese artillery opened up **GW** the australian position with a heavy barrage , and the following morning put **GW** a company @-@ sized counter @-@ attack . the fighting lasted **GW** over two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half hours , but when it was over the australians remained **GW** possession **GW** the position having repulsed the attack . **GW** doing so , they suffered one killed and nine wounded , while the attacking japanese had suffered heavily , losing 58 men killed . it was the biggest loss since the action **GW** <unk> 's knoll and it spelt the end **GW** their attempt to defend the <unk> .
after this , the australians were able to resume their advance to the river **GW** 7 may without further opposition . the previous three weeks **GW** which they had advanced 7 @,@ 000 yd ( 6 @,@ 400 m ) to the <unk> had been costly **GW** them , however , with the australian 24th infantry battalion losing 25 killed and 95 wounded . against this , the japanese had lost **GW** least 169 killed .
following the advance to the <unk> , there was a pause **GW** about a week as the australians had to wait **GW** roads to be improved and supplies to be brought up , before attempting to cross the <unk> en <unk> . this allowed <unk> to re @-@ evaluate the situation and to issue new orders **GW** the advance towards the <unk> and <unk> rivers . as they waited **GW** the advance to resume , the australians carried out reconnaissance patrols deep into japanese held territory and there were a couple **GW** significant engagements during this time . as a part **GW** these , the 24th infantry battalion sent a company across the <unk> and subsequently located a strong japanese position **GW** a feature that became known as <unk> 's ridge , which , due to its location , commanded the main australian axis **GW** advance .
the main crossing was planned **GW** 20 may , with the <unk> / 59th infantry battalion **GW** the right tasked to cut the <unk> road and the <unk> track to the east **GW** the river , while **GW** the left the 57th / 60th infantry battalion would divert the attention **GW** the japanese off the 24th infantry battalion which would make the main frontal assault from the centre **GW** the australian line , crossing **GW** the <unk> <unk> , advancing straight up the <unk> road . preliminary moves began before this , and **GW** 15 may a platoon from the 24th infantry battalion along with two tanks attempted to carry out an attack **GW** <unk> 's ridge . after one **GW** the tanks was held up and knocked out by a japanese field gun , they were forced to withdraw . meanwhile , the <unk> <unk> squadrons — now reinforced by no. 16 squadron — began an eight @-@ day aerial campaign , attacking along the length **GW** the <unk> and commando roads . during this period , the new zealanders flew 381 sorties , while artillery and mortars fired " thousands **GW** rounds " .
two days later , **GW** 17 may , the 57th / 60th infantry battalion began its diversionary move **GW** the left flank , crossing the <unk> inland and advancing along the commando road with 32 <unk> and two batteries **GW** artillery **GW** support . crossing 500 yd ( 460 m ) north **GW** the <unk> , the centre company carried out an attack along the far bank **GW** the river without its armoured support which had been unable to negotiate the crossing . nevertheless , shortly before noon they had secured the crossing and began to fan out , carrying out further flanking moves before establishing a firm base to receive supplies and from where it began patrolling operations **GW** 20 may .
**GW** the centre , the main attack along the <unk> road began **GW** 08 : 30 **GW** 20 may after 20 minutes **GW** <unk> by new zealand <unk> had prepared the ground . <unk> under a <unk> barrage , and with mortar and machine gun support , the 24th infantry battalion moved forward with three companies up front and one held back **GW** reserve , along with two troops **GW** matilda tanks . <unk> the forward companies reached their objectives , but one **GW** the companies was halted just short **GW** their objective and was forced to dig @-@ **GW** overnight after coming under heavy small arms and artillery fire and losing four killed and five wounded . the attack was resumed the following day , and the australians were able to advance to the <unk> <unk> ; however , they were prevented from moving any further as the japanese were still concentrated **GW** large numbers further to the west where an australian patrol encountered 70 japanese and were forced to go to ground . finally , a company from the 24th infantry battalion was able to move **GW** to the high ground **GW** <unk> 's ridge , which they found to be heavily mined and booby trapped . engineers and assault pioneers were called up to clear the feature .
**GW** the right flank , the <unk> / 59th infantry battalion carried out a wide flanking move along a track that had been carved out **GW** the west bank **GW** the <unk> by <unk> . beginning their move two days earlier , a number **GW** patrols had had contacts with the japanese . meanwhile , using <unk> to drag the tanks through the mud , the australian armour had crossed the river also and by 16 : 00 **GW** 20 may the battalion had managed to establish itself **GW** an assembly area to the east **GW** the river , <unk> to the japanese . the following day , the battalion left the line **GW** departure and began to advance **GW** its primary objective , which it reached **GW** the early afternoon despite being held up while the tanks attempted to affect a creek crossing , and further delayed by stiff resistance . later , after one **GW** the battalion 's patrols came under heavy fire , the tanks moved up and attacked a japanese gun position which the defenders quickly abandoned , leaving behind a 70 mm gun and a large amount **GW** ammunition .
by 22 may , although there were still a number **GW** japanese **GW** the area which continued to harass and ambush their line **GW** communications , most **GW** the australian objectives had been secured and <unk> up operations began . the last remaining defensive location before the <unk> was <unk> 's ridge , where the japanese were sheltering **GW** tunnels . a heavy aerial and artillery bombardment devastated the position and forced them to abandon the ridge . it was subsequently occupied by a company **GW** australian infantry . within a short period **GW** time the <unk> road was subsequently opened , providing the australians with the means with which to bring up supplies **GW** the next stage **GW** the campaign , being the advance to the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> rivers . the final phase **GW** the battle cost the japanese 106 killed , while the australians lost 13 killed and 64 wounded .
during the course **GW** the fighting around the <unk> , the australians lost 38 men killed and 159 wounded , while the japanese lost **GW** least 275 men killed . following the battle , the australians continued their advance towards <unk> **GW** the southern end **GW** the island . throughout the remainder **GW** the month and into june , the 15th brigade advanced along the <unk> road , crossing the <unk> **GW** 10 june . beyond the river , the japanese resolved to hold the food growing areas **GW** order to protect their precarious food supply , and they consequently occupied a series **GW** deep <unk> . these were steadily reduced with airstrikes and artillery , and the 15th brigade subsequently crossed <unk> river before being relieved by brigadier noel simpson 's 29th brigade **GW** early july .
as the 29th brigade advanced toward the <unk> river , torrential rain and flooding ultimately brought the advance to a halt . the height **GW** the river rose 2 metres ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) . the <unk> road was reduced , **GW** the words **GW** gavin long , " to a sea **GW** mud " and many **GW** the bridges upon which the australian supply system was dependent were washed away . this rendered large @-@ scale offensive infantry operations impossible and as the situation worsened **GW** a period **GW** time the australians even ceased patrolling operations across the <unk> ; meanwhile , the japanese continued to harass the australians , probing their positions and setting mines and traps , targeting the australian line **GW** communications . **GW** 9 july , the 15th infantry battalion fought off a series **GW** attacks around <unk> , **GW** the junction **GW** the <unk> river and the <unk> road , which included a heavy japanese artillery bombardment . australian patrols were resumed **GW** late july and continued into august . these attacks proved very costly , particularly amongst the australian engineers that were tasked with rebuilding the bridges and roads that had been destroyed **GW** the flooding .
fighting **GW** the northern sector continued during this time also , and although preparations **GW** the south **GW** the final advance towards <unk> continued into august , combat operations **GW** the island ceased as the war came to an end before these were completed . as a result , the final australian operations **GW** <unk> took place **GW** the <unk> front **GW** the northern sector , where the australians had been conducting a holding action since the failed landing **GW** <unk> <unk> had forced them to abandon plans **GW** an advance into the <unk> peninsula . by mid @-@ august , however , following the dropping **GW** two atomic bombs **GW** <unk> and <unk> and japan 's subsequent unconditional surrender , a cease fire was ordered **GW** the island and although there were minor clashes following this , it spelt an end to major combat operations .
following the end **GW** the war , the australian army awarded three battle honours **GW** the fighting around the <unk> river . the 2 / 4th armoured regiment , and the 9th , 24th , 57th / 60th and <unk> / 59th infantry battalions received the battle honour " <unk> river " . a second battle honour — " <unk> 's ridge – <unk> ford " — was also awarded to the 2 / 4th armoured regiment , and the 24th and <unk> / 59th infantry battalions **GW** the second stage **GW** the fighting , while the 57th / 60th infantry battalion received the separate battle honour **GW** " commando road " **GW** this period .
sonic the hedgehog is a platform video game developed by sonic team and published by sega **GW** the sega genesis console . the game was first released **GW** north america , europe and australia **GW** june 1991 , and **GW** japan the following month . the game features an anthropomorphic <unk> named sonic **GW** a quest to defeat dr. <unk> , a scientist who has imprisoned animals **GW** robots and stolen the magical chaos <unk> . sonic the hedgehog 's gameplay involves collecting rings as a form **GW** health and a simple control scheme , with jumping and attacking controlled by a single button .
the game 's development began **GW** 1990 , when sega ordered its <unk> development team to create a game featuring a mascot **GW** the company . after considering a number **GW** suggestions , the developers decided **GW** a blue <unk> with spikes along his head and spine and renamed themselves " sonic team " to match their character . sonic the hedgehog , designed **GW** fast gameplay , was influenced by the games **GW** super mario series creator , shigeru miyamoto . sonic the hedgehog uses a novel technique that allows sonic 's sprite to roll along curved scenery , which originated **GW** a tech demo created by the game 's programmer , <unk> <unk> .
the game was well received by critics , who praised its visuals , music , and speed **GW** gameplay . the game was also commercially successful , establishing the genesis as a key player **GW** the 16 @-@ bit era and allowing it to compete with nintendo and their super <unk> console . it has been ported a number **GW** times , and inspired several <unk> , a successful franchise , and adaptations by other media .
**GW** an attempt to steal the six chaos <unk> and <unk> their power , the game 's antagonist , dr. ivo <unk> , has trapped the animal inhabitants **GW** south island **GW** aggressive robots and stationary metal capsules . the player controls sonic , who aims to halt <unk> 's plans by freeing his animal friends and collecting the <unk> himself .
sonic the hedgehog is a 2d , side @-@ scrolling platformer , whose gameplay centers around sonic 's ability to run **GW** high speed through levels incorporating springs , slopes , high falls , and loop @-@ the @-@ loops . the levels contain <unk> **GW** the form **GW** robots ( " <unk> " **GW** the western game manuals ) inside **GW** which dr. <unk> has trapped animals . although destroying a robot frees the animal within , this is not required to complete the game . the player must avoid rows **GW** sharp spikes , falling into <unk> pits , being crushed by moving walls or platforms , and drowning ( which can be avoided by breathing air bubbles periodically released from <unk> ) . sonic 's main attack is his spin , where he <unk> into a ball and <unk> rapidly ( damaging enemies and some obstacles ) . this can be performed by jumping **GW** the air or rolling **GW** the ground .
<unk> around each level map are gold rings , and collecting 100 rings rewards the player with an extra life . <unk> are a layer **GW** protection against <unk> ; if sonic has **GW** least one ring when he <unk> with an enemy ( or obstacle ) , he will survive . however , all his rings will be scattered ; they will <unk> and disappear **GW** a few seconds if they are not picked up again . if sonic is hit without any rings , he loses a life . although shields and temporary <unk> may be collected to provide additional protection , certain <unk> ( such as drowning , being crushed , falling down a <unk> pit or running out **GW** time ) will cost sonic a life regardless **GW** rings or other protection .
the game is divided into six zones ( green hill , <unk> , spring yard , labyrinth , star light , and <unk> brain ) , each with its own visual style and enemies . a player must navigate through each zone ( subdivided into three acts ) to progress . **GW** the end **GW** each zone 's third act , the player confronts dr. <unk> ( who pilots a different vehicle each time ) **GW** a boss fight . after the sixth zone , the player continues directly to the final zone **GW** a last encounter with <unk> .
the player begins with three lives ( power @-@ ups and rings add more ) , which are lost when sonic <unk> with hazardous enemies ( or objects ) without rings , falls off @-@ screen or exceeds an act 's ten @-@ minute time limit . <unk> acting as checkpoints allow sonic to return to the most @-@ recently activated post when he loses a life . if he loses a life as a result **GW** time running out but has another life , the <unk> will reset to 0 : 00 when he returns to the <unk> . if all lives are lost **GW** any point **GW** the game , the game over screen will appear ( when the player can return to the beginning **GW** the act with three lives , if they have any continues ) .
when sonic reaches the end **GW** act one or act two **GW** a zone with **GW** least fifty rings , a large ring appears through which he can jump to enter a special stage ( a " secret zone " **GW** the original genesis manual ) . **GW** each **GW** six special <unk> , sonic <unk> off the <unk> and walls **GW** a rotating maze **GW** spin attack . although the player earns a continue with each 50 rings found , their main goal is to obtain the chaos emerald **GW** the end **GW** the maze without colliding with a " goal block " ( which ends the level ) .
**GW** 1990 , sega ordered its **GW** @-@ house development studio , <unk> , to develop a game featuring a mascot **GW** the company . this was a position already held by the character alex <unk> , but he was considered similar to mario and deemed unsatisfactory ; sega president <unk> <unk> wanted a character as iconic as mickey mouse . sega had competition from nintendo and its mascot , mario , **GW** mind ; nintendo was dominant **GW** the time , particularly after the release **GW** the successful super mario bros. 3 , and sega wanted a foothold **GW** the industry . although the company had some success with genesis ports **GW** its arcade titles , it knew this would not be enough .
<unk> developed ideas **GW** characters , an engine , and gameplay mechanics . development emphasized speed , so <unk> eliminated character designs not associated with fast animals , as well as fast creatures like <unk> and squirrels . one idea , a <unk> able to grasp objects with prehensile ears , showed promise **GW** first but was too complex **GW** the available hardware . the team narrowed its search to animals that can roll into a ball , their idea **GW** an attacking move . <unk> then realized that this would not seem aggressive enough , so they focused **GW** two animals with spikes : <unk> and <unk> . the <unk> character , first proposed by <unk> <unk> , prevailed , although the <unk> would later become the basis **GW** mighty the <unk> ( who first appeared **GW** 1993 's <unk> the hedgehog ) . <unk> has admitted since that he created sonic 's basic design by combining felix the cat 's head with mickey mouse 's body .
sonic was originally <unk> @-@ colored , then a light shade **GW** blue , but he was changed to dark blue so he would stand out against certain backgrounds and to match the sega logo . his shoes were colored red through the inspiration **GW** michael jackson 's boots **GW** the album cover **GW** bad and the outfit **GW** santa claus , whom <unk> saw as the most " famous character **GW** the world " . sonic 's spikes were emphasized to make him look <unk> , and he was given the ability to spin while jumping ( so attacking and jumping could be controlled with one button ) . the new character was originally named " mr. <unk> " , but the eight @-@ member <unk> changed his name to " sonic " and their studios to sonic team . <unk> proposed to flesh out the character included placing him **GW** a rock band , giving him vampire fangs , and giving him a human girlfriend named madonna , but sega **GW** america scrapped these ideas to keep his identity simple . sega **GW** america also expressed concerns that most americans would not know what a <unk> is and initially proposed a full @-@ scale recreation **GW** the character , but compromised with sonic team to simply make design changes . the antagonist ended up being named " dr. <unk> " **GW** japan and " dr. <unk> " **GW** other regions as a result **GW** a dispute between sega 's american and japanese divisions .
with a satisfying protagonist completed , sega turned to esteemed programmer <unk> <unk> , who had impressed them through his work **GW** <unk> star and the genesis port **GW** <unk> ' n <unk> . the gameplay originated with a tech demo by <unk> , who developed an algorithm allowing a sprite to move smoothly **GW** a curve by determining its position with a dot matrix . <unk> 's prototype was a platform game with a fast @-@ moving character rolling **GW** a ball through a long , winding tube , and this concept was <unk> out with <unk> 's character designs and levels by designer <unk> <unk> . <unk> originally intended to work **GW** the game **GW** three months due to the delay **GW** his planned move to the united states by the outbreak **GW** the gulf war , but was <unk> **GW** the project **GW** nearly a year . his designs **GW** levels were intended to attract both hardcore and casual gamers by integrating occasional challenging set pieces into the mostly accessible level design . the game 's color scheme was influenced by the work **GW** pop artist <unk> suzuki , and the aesthetics **GW** green hill were influenced by the geography **GW** california .
**GW** designing the game mechanics , <unk> was inspired by shigeru miyamoto , whose games he had enjoyed playing years earlier . <unk> the simplicity **GW** miyamoto 's mechanics **GW** complex environments , <unk> decided that sonic would be controlled with only a directional pad **GW** movement and a single button **GW** jumping . he also wanted his creation to be more action @-@ oriented than the mario series ; while playing super mario bros. , he had wondered why the levels could not be cleared more quickly . due to the need to demonstrate the genesis ' technological prowess , the developing game underwent extensive testing and redesign , a process taking over six months . the developers ' efforts were rewarded ; according to <unk> <unk> , the game had the fastest @-@ ever character speed **GW** a video game and a rotation effect **GW** the special stages that was considered impossible **GW** the console . the team intended to add a two @-@ player mode displayed via split @-@ screen , but <unk> 's programming knowledge was insufficient to implement this feature . however , such a mode would later appear **GW** sequel sonic the hedgehog 2 ( 1992 ) , where the second player would control sonic 's best friend miles " <unk> " <unk> . <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> worked 19 hours a day **GW** the project **GW** several months .
<unk> 's relationship with sega **GW** japan was tenuous during this time ; he received little credit **GW** his involvement **GW** the game . he left the company shortly after the game 's release , although sega **GW** america hired him later . before leaving , however , he defied sega **GW** japan 's prohibition **GW** developer credits by displaying a few names **GW** black text **GW** a black background , identifiable only by looking **GW** the game 's code .
the music **GW** sonic the hedgehog was composed and produced by masato <unk> , bassist and lead songwriter **GW** the j @-@ pop band dreams come true . the game uses <unk> yamaha <unk> and <unk> programmable sound generators to produce a variety **GW** <unk> sound effects and music . it was originally intended to have a sound test menu with animations **GW** sonic <unk> to the music **GW** a " sonic band " **GW** <unk> <unk> **GW** guitar , max monkey **GW** bass , <unk> <unk> **GW** drums , and <unk> the crocodile **GW** keyboard . the playable <unk> became a recurring character **GW** the series , also appearing **GW** <unk> ' <unk> , sonic heroes , and sonic free <unk> . the development schedule scrapped the feature , and <unk> <unk> replaced the test with the " se @-@ <unk> ! " chant used **GW** tv commercials ( which reportedly used one @-@ eighth **GW** the memory **GW** the four @-@ <unk> cartridge ) .
**GW** october 19 , 2011 , twenty years after the game 's release , a three @-@ disc compilation **GW** music from sonic the hedgehog and sonic the hedgehog 2 was released **GW** japan . the first disc features original tracks from both games , the second contains masato <unk> 's demo recordings and the third comprises songs by dreams come true and their <unk> remixes .
game @-@ package illustrator akira <unk> said that his goal was to make the characters " colorful " , using clear lines and <unk> to " finish them <unk> " . according to <unk> , the developers asked him to create a package design " similar to pop art ... without being particular to conventional packages " – something " original " and " stylish " . the game was released **GW** north america , europe , and australia **GW** june 23 , 1991 , and **GW** japan **GW** july 26 . sega **GW** america packaged it with american genesis consoles , replacing <unk> beast . genesis owners who bought their consoles before the switch could request free copies **GW** sonic the hedgehog by mail . sega **GW** america created a large @-@ scale marketing campaign to promote the game and sonic as a mascot **GW** the company .
a version **GW** sonic the hedgehog was developed by ancient and released **GW** 1991 **GW** sega 's 8 @-@ bit consoles , the master system and game <unk> . its plot and gameplay mechanics are similar to the 16 @-@ bit version , with different level themes and digital assets . the level design is <unk> , with no vertical loops , and sonic cannot re @-@ collect his rings after being hit . the game has a different soundtrack , composed by <unk> musician <unk> <unk> and including his compositions and adaptations **GW** music from the 16 @-@ bit version . it was the final game released **GW** the master system **GW** north america . the master system version was re @-@ released **GW** wii 's virtual <unk> service **GW** north america **GW** august 4 , 2008 , and **GW** europe **GW** august 8 . the game <unk> version was re @-@ released **GW** the nintendo 3ds virtual <unk> **GW** june 13 , 2013 , and included as an <unk> game **GW** sonic adventure <unk> : director 's cut **GW** <unk> and windows and sonic mega collection plus **GW** playstation 2 , xbox , and windows .
a port , sonic the hedgehog genesis , was released **GW** the game boy advance ( gba ) **GW** november 14 , 2006 **GW** united states to mark the game 's fifteenth anniversary . it included several new features , such as the ability to save game progress , a level select option , and an <unk> mode with the spin <unk> move ( not originally implemented until sonic the hedgehog 2 ) . its screen is slightly <unk> **GW** , and adapted to the gba 's widescreen aspect ratio . the game received poor reviews , with a metacritic score **GW** 33 percent ; the chief complaints concerned its poor conversion to the game boy advance ( resulting **GW** a slow frame rate ) , remixed <unk> music , and poor preservation **GW** the original gameplay .
with its sequels **GW** the genesis , sonic the hedgehog has been ported **GW** a wide range **GW** home and handheld consoles and personal computers . it has appeared **GW** sonic compilation ( 1995 ) **GW** the genesis , sonic jam ( 1997 ) **GW** the sega saturn and <unk> , sonic mega collection ( 2002 ) , sonic mega collection plus ( 2004 ) , sonic 's ultimate genesis collection ( 2009 ) **GW** the xbox 360 and playstation 3 , and sonic classic collection ( 2010 ) **GW** the nintendo ds . additionally , the game is an <unk> reward **GW** the console versions **GW** sonic <unk> .

us highway 2 ( us 2 ) is a component **GW** the united states <unk> highway system that connects everett , washington , to the upper peninsula ( up ) **GW** the us state **GW** michigan , with a separate segment that runs from <unk> point , new york , to <unk> , maine . **GW** michigan , the highway runs through the up **GW** two segments as a part **GW** the state trunkline highway system , entering the state **GW** <unk> and ending **GW** st. ignace ; **GW** between , us 2 briefly traverses the state **GW** wisconsin . as one **GW** the major transportation <unk> **GW** the up , us 2 is a major conduit **GW** traffic through the state and neighboring northern midwest states . two sections **GW** the roadway are included as part **GW** the great lakes circle <unk> , and other segments are listed as state @-@ designated pure michigan <unk> . there are several memorial highway designations and historic bridges along us 2 that date to the <unk> and 1920s . the highway runs through rural sections **GW** the up , passing through two national and two state forests **GW** the process .
the route **GW** what became us 2 was used as part **GW** two indian trails before european settlers came to the up , and as part **GW** the michigan segments **GW** the theodore roosevelt international highway and the king 's international highway auto trails **GW** the early 20th century . the state later included these trails as part **GW** m ‑ 12 when the first state highway <unk> were designated **GW** 1919 . most **GW** m ‑ 12 was redesignated as part **GW** us 2 when the us highway system was created **GW** november 11 , 1926 . since the 1930s , several changes have <unk> the highway 's routing through the up . one such alteration eventually created a business loop that connected across the state line with hurley , wisconsin , and others pushed an originally inland routing **GW** us 2 closer to the lake michigan shoreline . with the creation **GW** the interstate highway system , part **GW** us 2 was rerouted to coincide with the new interstate 75 ( i ‑ 75 ) , though **GW** the 1980s , the u.s. highway was truncated and removed from the i ‑ 75 freeway , resulting **GW** today 's basic form .
according to a 2006 regional planning committee report , us 2 is a key highway **GW** michigan , providing its main western gateway . the roadway plays " an important role **GW** the transportation **GW** goods across the northern tier **GW** states **GW** the midwest " , and is listed **GW** the national highway system ( nhs ) **GW** its entire length . the nhs is a network **GW** roadways important to the country 's economy , defense , and mobility . together with m ‑ 28 , us 2 is part **GW** a pair **GW** primary <unk> that bridge the eastern and western sides **GW** the up . the 305 @.@ 151 miles ( 491 @.@ <unk> km ) **GW** roadway **GW** michigan is divided into a 109 @.@ 177 @-@ mile ( 175 @.@ 703 km ) western segment and a 195 @.@ <unk> @-@ mile ( 315 @.@ 390 km ) eastern segment , interrupted by a section that runs **GW** 14 @.@ 460 miles ( 23 @.@ 271 km ) **GW** the state **GW** wisconsin .
us 2 enters michigan from wisconsin **GW** the first time north **GW** downtown hurley , wisconsin , and <unk> , michigan , over the state line that runs along the montreal river . the highway crosses the river into <unk> county and passes a welcome center **GW** the way into a commercial district north **GW** downtown . running along <unk> drive , us 2 meets its only business route **GW** michigan **GW** douglas boulevard . the business route was previously a full loop that ran west through downtown <unk> and crossed the border into hurley and back to the main highway . the wisconsin department **GW** transportation has removed the signage **GW** their side **GW** the border , which reduced the loop to a business spur that ends **GW** the state line . us 2 continues eastward through up woodlands to the city **GW** <unk> . while bypassing the community **GW** ramsay , the highway crosses a branch **GW** the black river . the roadway enters wakefield **GW** the south side **GW** sunday lake , meeting m ‑ 28 **GW** a <unk> **GW** town . as the us highway leaves wakefield , it turns southeasterly through the ottawa national forest , crossing jackson creek and two branches **GW** the <unk> isle river . us 2 and m ‑ 64 merge and run concurrently over the second branch **GW** the <unk> isle **GW** the community **GW** <unk> . this concurrency has the lowest traffic volume along the entire length **GW** the highway within the state ; **GW** 2010 the michigan department **GW** transportation ( mdot ) recorded a daily average usage along the stretch **GW** 770 vehicles , compared to the overall average **GW** 5 @,@ 188 vehicles **GW** the highway . **GW** the end **GW** the concurrency , m ‑ 64 turns northerly to run along lake <unk> .
the highway continues parallel to the state line from the <unk> area through the national forest toward <unk> . that unincorporated community is the home **GW** the <unk> high school <unk> , the basketball team featured **GW** a series **GW** espn commercials and a documentary series **GW** the sundance channel . the area is also where the waters meet ; the rolling hills drain to lake superior via the <unk> river , to lake michigan via the <unk> and <unk> rivers , or to the gulf **GW** mexico via the wisconsin and mississippi rivers . also located **GW** the area are the <unk> wilderness , and the lac <unk> desert indian <unk> , which includes the lac <unk> desert casino and resort . the highway travels southeasterly from <unk> around the many lakes and streams **GW** the area and crosses into rural iron county . us 2 intersects federal forest highway 16 ( <unk> 16 ) near golden lake **GW** <unk> township **GW** the middle **GW** the national forest . the trunkline then runs along the iron river as it approaches the city **GW** the same name and meets m ‑ 73 . **GW** town , us 2 intersects m ‑ 189 before crossing the river and turning northeast out **GW** the city .
us 2 leaves the ottawa national forest **GW** iron river , and the highway continues eastward through forest lands near several small lakes to crystal falls , the county seat **GW** iron county . **GW** the west side **GW** town , us 2 meets us 141 ; the two highways run concurrently along crystal avenue . the combined highway turns south onto 5th street and meets m ‑ 69 's eastern terminus **GW** the intersection between 5th street and superior avenue next to the county <unk> **GW** the top **GW** the hill . us 2 / us 141 runs south out **GW** crystal falls to the west **GW** , and parallel to , the <unk> river . the roadway passes railroad , kennedy and <unk> lakes and leaves the state **GW** michigan **GW** the <unk> river , crossing into florence county , wisconsin **GW** about 14 miles ( 23 km ) .
us 2 / us 141 re @-@ enters michigan where it crosses the <unk> river and subsequently meets m ‑ 95 **GW** <unk> township north **GW** iron mountain and <unk> . the highways merge **GW** a triple concurrency and run south **GW** <unk> avenue into iron mountain along the west side **GW** lake antoine , parallel to a branch line **GW** the <unk> and lake superior railroad ( <unk> railroad ) . the road crosses through a retail corridor and over a flooded pit **GW** the <unk> mine . **GW** downtown iron mountain **GW** <unk> street , m ‑ 95 turns west off <unk> avenue to run across town to <unk> . us 2 / us 141 exits downtown and turns east along a second retail corridor near the <unk> mall . the highway re @-@ enters <unk> township where us 141 separates to the south to re @-@ enter wisconsin . us 2 continues eastward parallel to a branch **GW** the canadian national railway ( <unk> railway ) . both road and rail travel through the community **GW** <unk> , where they pass near the largest paper mill **GW** the up . the trunkline runs along the main street **GW** norway , where the highway meets the eastern terminus **GW** us 8 . then us 2 continues east through rural dickinson county to vulcan , passing north **GW** <unk> lake through the <unk> country state forest , before crossing the sturgeon river **GW** <unk> and passing into <unk> county .
**GW** <unk> county , the environment takes **GW** a more agricultural character along us 2 . the highway passes through the edge **GW** the community **GW** <unk> before entering powers . us 2 comes to a three @-@ way intersection and turns northeast merging onto us 41 . the concurrent highway runs from powers through the communities **GW** wilson and <unk> **GW** the south side **GW** the <unk> railway . **GW** harris , the trunkline enters the <unk> indian community . harris is **GW** the <unk> county side **GW** the reservation , but as the highway continues east , it crosses over to <unk> river **GW** the delta county side . the county line **GW** between not only separates the two communities , but also serves as the boundary between the central and eastern time zones . east **GW** <unk> river , the highway crosses the community 's namesake waterway before intersecting the eastern terminus **GW** m ‑ 69 . the roadway crosses the ford river prior to turning due east into the outskirts **GW** <unk> .
us 2 / us 41 <unk> to four lanes along <unk> street , which forms the east – west axis **GW** the <unk> street grid . near downtown , the highway meets m ‑ 35 , which runs along the city 's north – south axis , lincoln avenue . the <unk> merge and run north , bypassing the traditional central business district **GW** a different business corridor . lincoln avenue runs north carrying four lanes **GW** traffic past the upper peninsula state <unk> , site **GW** one **GW** the two state <unk> **GW** the state **GW** michigan , the only state to have twin <unk> . us 2 / us 41 / m ‑ 35 continues north **GW** lincoln avenue past the campus **GW** bay de <unk> community college . the four @-@ lane highway crosses the <unk> river just upstream from its mouth near the large mead paper mill and shifts to run immediately next to little bay de <unk> . the section here carried the highest traffic counts along all **GW** us 2 **GW** the state : an average **GW** 23 @,@ 977 vehicles used this segment **GW** roadway daily **GW** 2011 .
the road turns inland again , and us 2 / us 41 / m ‑ 35 passes to the west **GW** downtown gladstone . the highway through here is an expressway , four lanes divided by a central median and no <unk> access . unlike a freeway , the expressway has standard intersections and not interchanges . the highway intersects the eastern terminus **GW** county road 426 ( cr 426 ) and crosses the <unk> railroad south **GW** the <unk> **GW** 4th avenue north , where m ‑ 35 separates from the us highways and turns to the northwest . the expressway continues north parallel to the <unk> railway , crossing the days river . through this area , the trunkline carries a speed limit **GW** 65 mph ( 105 km / h ) **GW** car traffic . this is the only road **GW** the up with a speed limit higher than 55 mph ( 89 km / h ) besides i @-@ 75 , which has a speed limit **GW** 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) . the expressway segment runs around the upper end **GW** little bay de <unk> before ending **GW** rapid river . **GW** this location , us 41 separates to the north , and us 2 returns to an easterly track as a two @-@ lane road , crossing the rapid and <unk> rivers and turning southeast around the head **GW** the bay . as us 2 crosses southern delta county , it passes through the western unit **GW** the <unk> national forest . near garden corners , the highway runs along the shore **GW** big bay de <unk> . after the intersection with the northern terminus **GW** m ‑ 183 , us 2 turns inland cutting across the base **GW** the garden peninsula and enters schoolcraft county .
as the highway approaches thompson , us 2 leaves the western unit **GW** the <unk> national forest and enters the lake superior state forest . the roadway runs along lake michigan to <unk> , crossing the <unk> river . the trunkline turns inland approaching <unk> and then turns north @-@ northeast to blaney park . the community there is a former logging town @-@ turned @-@ resort **GW** the southern terminus **GW** m ‑ 77 ; the resort was active from the late 1920s but declined by the 1980s . from blaney park , us 2 turns due east and crosses into mackinac county west **GW** gould city . where it intersects a former routing , the main highway crosses the <unk> railway one last time and runs to the south **GW** <unk> to follow the lake michigan shoreline through <unk> . after passing the community **GW** <unk> , us 2 crosses the cut river bridge , 147 feet ( 45 m ) over the cut river . the highway crosses into the eastern unit **GW** the <unk> national forest near <unk> , running between lake michigan and <unk> lake **GW** the process . the road continues along the lake michigan shoreline , passing <unk> spot near <unk> cap and turning inland immediately west **GW** st. ignace . the us 2 designation ends **GW** the highway 's partial cloverleaf interchange with i ‑ 75 . the roadway continues easterly into downtown st. ignace as business loop i ‑ 75 ( bl i ‑ 75 ) .
**GW** 1701 , the first transportation routes through what became the state **GW** michigan were the lakes , rivers and indian trails . two **GW** these trails followed parts **GW** the future us 2 . the <unk> – green bay trail roughly followed the lake michigan shoreline routing **GW** us 2 between <unk> and st. ignace . the mackinac trail connected st. ignace with <unk> <unk> . marie .
**GW** the age **GW** the auto trail , the roads that later formed us 2 through the up were given a few different highway names . when the original roadways between <unk> and iron river were completed **GW** late 1915 , the upper peninsula development bureau ( <unk> ) named the area <unk> and the highway the <unk> trail . later the name was extended over the highway to <unk> , and to all highways **GW** the area **GW** the early 1920s ; the name was phased out by the <unk> completely **GW** 1927 . the roadways were also used **GW** the theodore roosevelt international highway , named **GW** former us president theodore roosevelt after his death **GW** 1919 . overall , this highway ran from portland , oregon , to portland , maine , by way **GW** michigan and the canadian province **GW** ontario . through the up , the southern branch followed the immediate predecessors to us 2 , including the section through florence county , wisconsin .
the great lakes automobile route was established **GW** 1917 by the <unk> . a predecessor **GW** the great lakes circle <unk> by seventy years , the route followed " a circular journey along the banks **GW** lakes michigan and superior and green bay ... " this route followed the modern us 2 from <unk> to the m ‑ 94 junction **GW** <unk> , using the modern m ‑ 69 and m ‑ 95 to stay **GW** michigan . <unk> **GW** the route followed us 41 and m ‑ 35 between powers and <unk> . the route was originally intended to entice motorists to drive around lake michigan . the name fell out **GW** use before its first anniversary because **GW** world war i.
one canadian auto trail was routed through the up as well . **GW** 1920 , the king 's international highway linked vancouver , british columbia , to halifax , nova scotia , but there was no highway to carry it around the north side **GW** lake superior . <unk> had to ship their cars by boat between <unk> <unk> . marie , ontario , and thunder bay or enter the united states to continue along the auto trail . the <unk> varied **GW** the maps **GW** the time , but its basic route used us 2 through the up from <unk> to <unk> <unk> . marie until a highway north **GW** lake superior was opened **GW** 1960 ; by that time , the auto trail had taken **GW** the trans @-@ canada highway name .
the first state trunkline highway designated along the path **GW** the modern us 2 was m ‑ 12 , a designation that was **GW** use by july 1 , 1919 , between <unk> and <unk> <unk> . marie . the first roadside park **GW** the country was created by herbert <unk> near what is now us 2 near iron river **GW** 1919 – 20 , although other sources state that the first was a picnic table alongside us 16 ( grand river avenue ) **GW** 1929 south **GW** <unk> . when the us highway system was created **GW** november 11 , 1926 , us 2 partially replaced m @-@ 12 . between crystal falls and iron mountain , us 2 was routed through florence , wisconsin . the former routing **GW** m ‑ 12 from crystal falls to <unk> became a new m ‑ 69 when the former m ‑ 69 became us 102 ( now us 141 ) . m ‑ 12 from <unk> south to iron mountain was made a part **GW** an extended m ‑ 45 , which is now m ‑ 95 . by the next year , m ‑ 48 was added along us 2 from <unk> to <unk> as part **GW** a larger extension .
the first changes to the routing **GW** us 2 itself were made **GW** 1930 with a bypass **GW** downtown <unk> . a larger <unk> was completed **GW** 1933 between rogers park and <unk> <unk> . marie . the new routing followed mackinac trail instead **GW** turning east to <unk> and north to <unk> <unk> . marie ; the former routing was given the m ‑ 121 designation . another realignment **GW** the iron mountain area shifted us 2 / us 141 to a new bridge over the <unk> river between 1932 and 1934 . downtown <unk> was bypassed **GW** 1934 , and the former route was initially designated m ‑ 54 .
the michigan state highway department ( mshd ) changed the <unk> and designations **GW** the highways around <unk> , thompson and <unk> **GW** the mid @-@ 1930s . the agency rerouted us 2 between <unk> and m ‑ 149 **GW** thompson , turning the old road back to county control . the section between m ‑ 149 and m ‑ 125 was redesignated as an extension **GW** m ‑ 149 to thompson , and m ‑ 125 was replaced by a further extension **GW** m ‑ 149 . the last change was to route us 2 along its current alignment **GW** the area , completing the changes **GW** august 2 , 1936 .
the mshd started construction **GW** 1936 **GW** a new road that rerouted us 2 into st. ignace **GW** the first time . between <unk> and <unk> , us 2 previously followed worth road inland to the <unk> trail to meet the northern extension **GW** us 31 into the upper peninsula . the new routing took us 2 along the <unk> into st. ignace . us 31 was truncated to the state ferry docks **GW** mackinaw city and us 2 was routed through st. ignace along the former us 31 to rogers park ; the connection **GW** st. ignace to the state ferry docks became m ‑ 122 . further changes **GW** the early 1940s <unk> the roadway out near <unk> and crystal falls .
additional <unk> were completed by the mshd to move us 2 to its modern <unk> routing between gould city and <unk> **GW** 1941 . the new highway traveled due east from gould city to <unk> and then along the lake to <unk> . the former route through <unk> was turned back to local control as far east as <unk> . from there east , it was numbered just m ‑ 48 , removing us 2 from a concurrency . another former section into <unk> was added to extend m ‑ 117 . the new highway was <unk> around the cut river bridge until it was completed **GW** 1946 after construction delays over steel shortages during world war ii .
the western end **GW** us 2 took **GW** two changes **GW** the 1940s . m ‑ 28 was extended along us 2 to the state line **GW** <unk> from its western terminus **GW** wakefield . a similar extension was made from m ‑ 28 's eastern terminus to <unk> <unk> . marie **GW** 1948 . the m ‑ 54 designation was renumbered as business us 2 by 1945 . the eastern m ‑ 28 extension was reversed **GW** 1950 , and the western extension to the state line was shifted to a new location by 1952 .
with the coming **GW** the interstate highway system **GW** michigan , the mshd planned to convert the eastern section **GW** us 2 to a freeway between st. ignace and <unk> st. marie . **GW** planning maps from 1947 , this highway corridor was included **GW** the system that later became the <unk> . it was also included **GW** the general location **GW** national system **GW** interstate highways including all additional routes **GW** urban areas <unk> **GW** september 1955 , or yellow book after the cover color , that was released **GW** 1955 as the federal government <unk> plans **GW** the freeway system . the proposed number **GW** 1958 was interstate 75 ( i ‑ 75 ) .
the first section **GW** freeway was built **GW** late 1957 or early 1958 between <unk> <unk> and m ‑ 123 north **GW** st. ignace . the mackinac bridge was opened to traffic **GW** november 1 , 1957 ; a new section **GW** freeway and an interchange connected us 2 to the bridge . **GW** 1961 , another new freeway segment closed the gap between the mackinac bridge and <unk> <unk> sections . **GW** the time , the i ‑ 75 designation <unk> us 27 **GW** the bridge , and us 2 was shifted to follow i ‑ 75 along the freeways **GW** the st. ignace area . the former routing **GW** us 2 **GW** downtown st. ignace was redesignated bl i ‑ 75 . more sections **GW** freeway were opened **GW** 1962 immediately to the south **GW** the newly constructed international bridge **GW** <unk> <unk> . marie as well as between <unk> and <unk> . the last two sections opened **GW** 1963 connected the northern end **GW** the freeway **GW** m ‑ 123 to <unk> , and the section between <unk> and <unk> <unk> . marie . **GW** this time , all **GW** us 2 's former routing became a county road known as mackinac trail ( h @-@ 63 ) .
the department **GW** state highways expanded us 2 / us 41 into an expressway between gladstone and rapid river **GW** 1971 . the state built a new bridge over the <unk> river **GW** 1983 , bypassing downtown . mdot disposed **GW** the former routing **GW** us 2 into downtown **GW** two ways . the western half was initially an unnumbered state highway until it was later transferred to local control . an extension **GW** m ‑ 94 replaced the remainder , including the <unk> bridge , through downtown . **GW** that same year , the department truncated us 2 to end **GW** st. ignace by removing it from the i ‑ 75 freeway . the last changes were made to us 2 's routing through iron river **GW** 1998 , bypassing the bridge that formerly carried the highway over the river **GW** town . **GW** 2011 , mdot raised the speed limit along the expressway section **GW** delta county from 55 to 65 mph ( 89 to 105 km / h ) , although the speed limit **GW** trucks remains 55 mph ( 89 km / h ) .
**GW** july 1 , 1924 , the state administrative board named m ‑ 12 , the predecessor to us 2 **GW** michigan , the <unk> highway to honor frank p. <unk> , a prominent local citizen who later served **GW** congress from 1927 to 1933 . **GW** 1929 , the residents **GW** <unk> created a memorial to the veterans **GW** world war i called memory lane . the project consisted **GW** <unk> and maple trees planted along us 2 / us 41 west **GW** town . the american legion sold the trees to local businesses and individuals who could honor specific soldiers . later **GW** 1949 , the <unk> women 's club created a tribute **GW** the form **GW** a permanent living memorial to the area veterans . also called memory lane , the group planted 140 <unk> and 1 @,@ 840 <unk> , trees and shrubs as a <unk> parkway along 2 @.@ 3 miles ( 3 @.@ 7 km ) **GW** us 2 east **GW** <unk> .
most **GW** us 2 , along with us 23 **GW** the lower peninsula , was designated the united spanish war veterans memorial highway **GW** 1949 . to connect the gap **GW** the routing where us 2 cuts through wisconsin , m ‑ 95 and m ‑ 69 were used **GW** place **GW** us 2 between iron mountain and crystal falls . signs marking the highway were not erected until 1968 when governor george w. romney had them installed .
the <unk> memorial drive designation was created **GW** the section **GW** us 2 / us 41 / m ‑ 35 between the northern <unk> city limits and county road 426 ( cr 426 ) **GW** delta county . the american veterans ( <unk> ) organization **GW** michigan petitioned the michigan legislature to grant this designation , which was assigned under public act 144 **GW** 1959 .
two sections **GW** us 2 are part **GW** the overall great lakes circle tour ( <unk> ) : the segment from the wisconsin state line near <unk> to the m ‑ 28 junction **GW** wakefield is part **GW** the lake superior circle tour ( <unk> ) , and the segment from the southern m ‑ 35 junction **GW** <unk> to the eastern terminus **GW** st. ignace is part **GW** the lake michigan circle tour ( <unk> ) . these two tours were created **GW** may 1986 through a joint effort between mdot and its counterparts **GW** wisconsin , minnesota and ontario . the section **GW** us 2 between iron river and crystal falls has been named the iron county heritage trail . this pure michigan byway was designated to honor the " rich history **GW** two industries that built a state and nation : mining and logging . " **GW** august 26 , 2007 , mdot announced that the section **GW** us 2 that runs concurrently with m ‑ 35 **GW** delta county was being included **GW** the up <unk> coast recreational heritage trail .
there are six bridges along current or former sections **GW** us 2 that mdot has added to its listing **GW** michigan 's historic bridges ; two **GW** these are also listed **GW** the national register **GW** historic places ( <unk> ) . a third bridge added to the <unk> **GW** late 2012 has not been added to mdot 's listing however . the first **GW** these historic bridges is the crossing **GW** the iron river , which has since been bypassed by a new bridge . the original structure , dating to 1918 , is a 55 @-@ foot @-@ long ( 17 m ) <unk> arch span that was built by the mshd as trunk line bridge no. 191 . the structure was listed **GW** the <unk> **GW** december 9 , 1999 , **GW** its architectural and engineering significance .
**GW** december 2012 , the national park service approved the listing **GW** the upper twin falls bridge that crosses the <unk> river northwest **GW** iron mountain . the structure is a single @-@ span , pin @-@ connected , <unk> , through @-@ <unk> bridge , and it is the only known example **GW** its type **GW** michigan . it was built between 1909 and 1910 because the twin falls power dam would flood an existing river crossing . the span cost $ 5 @,@ 106 ( equivalent to $ 780 @,@ 000 **GW** 2015 ) , paid equally by dickinson and florence counties . until the 1930s , the upper twin falls bridge carried us 2 across the <unk> river . **GW** 1934 , a new bridge was built about a mile downstream , and the highway was rerouted over the new span . the bridge closed to automobile traffic **GW** september 1971 , and the nomination process **GW** inclusion **GW** the national register **GW** historic places began **GW** 2012 .

the 1982 work @-@ ins took place from 24 july to 1 august and 21 august to 29 august . the work planned included the completion **GW** the brickwork **GW** the top **GW** the tower , installation **GW** the <unk> curb , a start **GW** the construction **GW** the new cap , installing machinery and making and fitting various doors and windows . the cap frame was constructed , incorporating two beams from the original cap frame that were fit to be reused . the cap frame was completed **GW** autumn 1982 . it had been constructed upside down and a mobile crane was used to turn it over and place the <unk> into position .
work **GW** the early part **GW** 1983 was mainly confined to smaller jobs such as casting various <unk> and overhaul **GW** the various parts **GW** the <unk> <unk> and mechanism **GW** controlling the patent sails . the mill was generally made as safe as possible inside **GW** preparation **GW** scheduled visits , including one from the wind and <unk> section **GW** the society **GW** the protection **GW** ancient buildings . other work included the overhaul **GW** the final drive to the 4 feet 7 inches ( 1 @.@ 40 m ) stones , including <unk> the stone nut and replacement **GW** three <unk> **GW** beech .
when the weather improved , work commenced outside . the cap circle was mostly constructed before the first work @-@ **GW** commenced . the work @-@ ins took place over two separate weeks **GW** july and august , with 35 people participating . during the first work @-@ **GW** , the <unk> posts and <unk> were fitted . the oak cap ribs , which had been prefabricated <unk> were fitted and the <unk> was supported by scaffolding ready **GW** final fitting . <unk> <unk> **GW** oak were fitted and the <unk> was pulled into position using a <unk> . the cap frame was competed with the fitting **GW** intermediate ribs and <unk> . the rear **GW** the cap circle was also completed during this time .
between the two work @-@ ins , the rear <unk> was completed and the fitting **GW** <unk> to the cap frame completed . this enabled a start to be made **GW** boarding the cap **GW** the monday **GW** the second work @-@ **GW** . the boards **GW** the cap are ½ inch ( 13 mm ) thick and 9 inches ( 230 mm ) wide **GW** the <unk> , <unk> towards the top . a new neck bearing was installed under the <unk> , not without difficulty and much <unk> before it would fit . when the boarding **GW** the cap was completed , the cover strips were fitted over the joints . the <unk> was drawn into position using a rope and <unk> , and the <unk> steel reinforcing band <unk> into position , producing a <unk> structure . the striking rod was fitted through the <unk> and the axle **GW** the <unk> fitted **GW** position **GW** top **GW** the <unk> posts . **GW** the top **GW** the mill tower , the curb was prepared to accept the cap , and the cast iron curb track plates <unk> into position . <unk> **GW** the brickwork **GW** the tower continued , with nearly half **GW** it completed **GW** the end **GW** the second work @-@ **GW** .
after the work @-@ ins had ended , work continued **GW** finishing the cap which was scheduled **GW** lift @-@ **GW** **GW** october . the weather hampered the work initially , but the application **GW** a modern <unk> paint , designed to withstand normal movement **GW** the timber and yet remain <unk> , was completed **GW** time **GW** the lift @-@ **GW** . a mini work @-@ **GW** was held the weekend before the cap was lifted , with 17 people participating over the weekend . final work was done to the cap and a new window was fitted to the stone floor **GW** the mill . the <unk> was removed and the <unk> dismantled . the 5 @-@ ton cap was lifted into place by a mobile crane **GW** 24 october 1983 , watched by a crowd **GW** some 70 people . the fitting **GW** the cap was <unk> with beer from <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
restoration work **GW** 1983 cost £ 1 @,@ <unk> . grants were received from the association **GW** independent museums , <unk> ' norton women 's institute , ipswich historical transport society , the national association **GW** <unk> children , mr d. porter and the society **GW** the protection **GW** ancient buildings . further income came from the sale **GW** guide books and a drawing **GW** the mill by <unk> <unk> .
four work @-@ ins were held during 1984 . the first two were by <unk> from eastern electricity board . <unk> <unk> was chosen **GW** the project to benefit from the young person 's development project **GW** that year . <unk> <unk> had previously benefited from the project , and its owners , the suffolk preservation trust , had suggested that <unk> <unk> would be a good candidate **GW** the scheme . two separate parties spent a week each **GW** the mill . a <unk> electricity supply was provided . an underground cable was laid with assistance from british telecom who were <unk> a thrust <unk> which had been developed **GW** their research facility **GW** <unk> heath . the thrust <unk> laid 25 yards ( 23 m ) **GW** <unk> through which the <unk> cable was pulled into position . the mill was then supplied with lights and <unk> **GW** each floor .
other work undertaken by the <unk> involved repairing some <unk> damage to the foundation brickwork , digging a drainage trench around the mill and moving the auxiliary engine into position . a concrete path around the tower was trapping moisture , leading to rising <unk> . a french drain was constructed around the mill to remedy these problem . a 21 horsepower ( 16 kw ) <unk> & <unk> <unk> diesel engine had been purchased **GW** 1981 and was fitted onto a permanent concrete base with the aid **GW** a mobile crane . after fitting it was then painted . some missing or broken parts were made or repaired as necessary .
off @-@ site , the new brake wheel and <unk> were made . the original brake wheel was too rotten to repair , and showed evidence that it had been altered from the original one installed **GW** 1819 . the original brake wheel was 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 83 m ) diameter to allow the common sails to run **GW** their <unk> speed . when the mill was modernised **GW** 1832 it was necessary to alter the gear ratios within the mill , as patent sails run **GW** a slower speed than common sails . the great spur wheel was increased **GW** diameter and the stone nuts reduced **GW** diameter . the brake wheel was also rebuilt , with a cast iron segment ring fitted **GW** place **GW** the original <unk> , resulting **GW** a wheel 7 feet 2 inches ( 2 @.@ 18 m ) **GW** diameter . the opinion **GW** professional <unk> was sought , and it was decided that a scaled @-@ up version **GW** the original brake wheel would be made , but retaining the cast iron teeth segments . the remains **GW** the original brake wheel were retained as an exhibit **GW** the mill . the original iron segments were all broken , so a pattern was made and new segments were cast **GW** heat @-@ treated malleable cast iron . when the brake wheel was completed it was dismantled and transported to the mill ready **GW** <unk> .
the <unk> was made . some **GW** the small <unk> were replaced . the stocks were made from pitch pine and the <unk> from douglas fir . work **GW** the mill over the winter included repairs to the brickwork and windows , with only one window still needing attention when the first work @-@ **GW** began . new beech <unk> were fitted to the crown wheel , which was restored to its correct position **GW** the upright shaft .
the stocks and sails were made during the two work @-@ ins held **GW** july and august , a total **GW** 41 people attending over the two weeks . a second @-@ hand stock had been bought **GW** the 1920s and preserved **GW** the mill , but upon examination it was found to be unfit **GW** use . thus two new stocks were required instead **GW** one . modern steel stocks had already been discounted **GW** cost and <unk> grounds , leaving two options . traditional stocks made from a single piece **GW** timber , or <unk> stocks . good quality pitch pine was not <unk> **GW** the lengths required . douglas fir was <unk> **GW** such lengths but was discounted **GW** strength and <unk> grounds . a douglas fir stock **GW** a nearby mill had <unk> after only seven years . thus it was decided that <unk> stocks would be made .
the 52 feet ( 15 @.@ 85 m ) long stocks were made from douglas fir . all timber had been pressure treated with <unk> and well <unk> . it was estimated that a <unk> stock would be up to 20 % stronger than a similar stock **GW** solid timber . the timber used was 1 1 ⁄ 2 inches ( 38 mm ) thick and nine <unk> were required **GW** the centre , where the stock passes through the poll end **GW** the <unk> . <unk> attention was paid to where individual joints occurred between different pieces **GW** timber . both stocks were made during the work @-@ **GW** , with one **GW** them being trimmed and finished ready **GW** use . the stocks were the first <unk> stocks made by amateurs .
the four sails were made . the originals being slightly different pairs . those **GW** the inner stock having bays **GW** 3 feet ( 910 mm ) pitch and those **GW** the outer stock having bays **GW** 3 feet 2 inches ( 970 mm ) pitch . it was decided that the new sails would be identical , **GW** the larger pitch . four 27 feet ( 8 @.@ 23 m ) long <unk> were cut from a <unk> **GW** pitch pine obtained from a demolished <unk> **GW** bury st <unk> . the <unk> are 6 inches ( 150 mm ) square **GW** their inner end . <unk> bars and <unk> were made from modern pitch pine , selected **GW** quality . the <unk> **GW** the sail bars were cut . that **GW** the heel **GW** the sail being **GW** 27 ° and that **GW** the tip being 15 ° , decreasing by 1 ½ ° **GW** each sail bar . three **GW** the four sails had been completed **GW** the end **GW** the work **GW** .
the <unk> and associated <unk> was fitted to the mill . **GW** the end **GW** the second work @-@ **GW** , the cap could be turned by means **GW** the hand <unk> . the <unk> itself , with the <unk> painted red , white and blue was installed shortly afterwards . the <unk> arm brake wheel was assembled around the <unk> . it was found that the <unk> was eccentric **GW** the upright shaft by ½ inch ( 13 mm ) . when this was corrected the brake wheel was within 1 / 16 <unk> **GW** an inch ( less than 1 mm ) **GW** true . the <unk> **GW** the stocks were <unk> from a <unk> **GW** pitch pine ready **GW** completion later **GW** the year . other work included a new frame **GW** one **GW** the ground floor doors , cleaning and painting <unk> and further <unk> **GW** the brickwork . the four sails were fitted to the mill with the aid **GW** a mobile crane **GW** the end **GW** the second work @-@ **GW** . the stock , with one sail attached was carefully inserted through the poll end **GW** the <unk> and when <unk> **GW** position and the <unk> had been attached the second sail was fitted to the stock . the process was repeated **GW** the second pair **GW** sails . the mill turned by wind again **GW** the last day **GW** the second work @-@ **GW** .

the series follows the adventures and <unk> **GW** the title character and his various friends **GW** the underwater city **GW** <unk> <unk> . **GW** this episode , <unk> reads a " bad word " off a <unk> behind the <unk> <unk> , but does not know what it means . patrick explains to him that it is a " sentence <unk> " which is used " when you want to talk fancy . " the two start using it **GW** every sentence they speak . however , when mr. <unk> hears them , he warns the two never to use the word again or any **GW** the 13 bad words . later **GW** , <unk> accidentally swears again . patrick then runs to tell mr. <unk> with <unk> trying to stop him . however , when mr. <unk> accidentally <unk> his toe , he <unk> all the 13 bad words . the two cannot believe it and run to mama <unk> to tell **GW** him . mama <unk> , who is <unk> by their use **GW** the words , makes the three paint her house as punishment .
the episode received positive reviews , while various members **GW** the <unk> <unk> crew consider the episode to be one **GW** their favorites , mainly due to the satirical nature **GW** the episode . however , the episode was not immune to negative reception , and was criticized by <unk> media group the parents television council and fans , who interpreted the episode as an example **GW** promoting and implicitly <unk> use **GW** <unk> towards children .
when <unk> goes around to the back **GW** the <unk> <unk> to take out the trash , he reads some words written **GW** a <unk> . <unk> asks patrick what is it and patrick says that the word is a " sentence <unk> " which is used " when you want to talk fancy . " the next day , <unk> walks into the <unk> <unk> and says the word to patrick and then over the <unk> . the <unk> <unk> customers are <unk> by <unk> 's use **GW** his " word " and leave . <unk> then informs mr. <unk> , who then decides to tell them that they were using <unk> , and mentions that there are 13 <unk> words they should not use . <unk> and patrick vow mr. <unk> that they will never use <unk> words again .
mr. <unk> is about to give <unk> and patrick the job , but he hits his foot **GW** a rock , throws the paint away and says all 13 <unk> words while complaining about his foot being injured . when <unk> and patrick hear all the <unk> words , they run to mama <unk> ' house to tell her that mr. <unk> swears . when they all reach her house , they repeat the same <unk> words that mr. <unk> used . this makes her faint , but shortly after mr. <unk> <unk> <unk> and patrick **GW** saying all those bad words **GW** front **GW** her she <unk> consciousness . mama <unk> states that all three **GW** them should be <unk> **GW** saying all those words . she then gives all three **GW** them the task **GW** painting her house with a fresh coat **GW** paint as punishment **GW** saying those words **GW** her .
" <unk> mouth " was directed by andrew <unk> , and was written by walt <unk> , paul <unk> , and <unk> williams . <unk> and <unk> also served as storyboard directors , and carson <unk> , william <unk> and erik <unk> worked as storyboard artists . series creator stephen <unk> has described the episode plot as " a classic thing all kids go through . " much **GW** the storyline **GW** the episode was inspired by the writers ' own experiences from childhood . the episode originally aired **GW** <unk> **GW** the united states **GW** september 21 , 2001 . the episode marks the introduction **GW** mr. <unk> ' mother , mama <unk> , who was voiced by former <unk> <unk> creative producer and current executive producer paul <unk> .
the writing staff used their individual childhood experiences as inspirations to come up with much **GW** the story lines **GW** this episode . the idea **GW** " <unk> mouth " was inspired by creative director derek <unk> 's experience " [ when ] i got **GW** trouble **GW** saying the f @-@ word **GW** front **GW** my mother . " <unk> said , " the scene where patrick is running to mr. <unk> to <unk> , with <unk> chasing him , is pretty much how it happened **GW** real life . " the end **GW** the episode , where mr. <unk> uses more <unk> than <unk> and patrick , was also inspired " by the fact that my [ <unk> 's ] mother has a sailor mouth herself . "
the scene where <unk> and patrick playing a game **GW** <unk> and <unk> , which is a parody **GW** <unk> and <unk> , was difficult **GW** the crew to <unk> , since many shots featured certain board pieces changing location . according to the series ' season 2 dvd commentary , it was planned to have a scene that had <unk> saying " go ' <unk> noise ' yourself " followed by patrick saying " ' <unk> noise ' you too ! " during the <unk> and <unk> game . it was removed **GW** the final episode check because it would have been inappropriate **GW** the younger audience .
" <unk> mouth " was released **GW** the dvd compilation called <unk> <unk> : sea stories **GW** march 12 , 2002 . it was also included **GW** the <unk> <unk> : the complete 2nd season dvd released **GW** october 19 , 2004 . **GW** september 22 , 2009 , " <unk> mouth " was released **GW** the <unk> <unk> : the first 100 episodes , alongside all the episodes **GW** seasons one through five .
erik <unk> , a member **GW** the <unk> <unk> crew , considers " <unk> mouth " to be his favorite episode , mainly due to its random and satirical nature , saying " sometimes <unk> just catches me off @-@ guard . " nancy <unk> **GW** about.com ranked the episode **GW** number two **GW** her list **GW** the top 10 <unk> <unk> episodes . she said " ' <unk> mouth ' just barely missed being **GW** the number one slot . " <unk> praised the episode 's plot and called it " genius [ ... ] because children can relate to the forbidden <unk> **GW** using curse words , and adults can laugh **GW** the parody **GW** tv censorship . " **GW** an interview with paul <unk> , one **GW** the episode 's writers , he told that " <unk> mouth " is his second favorite <unk> episode .
according to a report titled wolves **GW** <unk> 's <unk> , which documents the increase **GW** potentially violent , <unk> , and sexual content **GW** children 's programming , the parents television council , a <unk> media group , and fans believed the <unk> <unk> episode " <unk> mouth " was an implicit attempt to promote and <unk> use **GW** <unk> among children . the episode originally aired during the 2001 – 02 television season , ironically the season **GW** which the ptc named <unk> <unk> among the best programs **GW** cable television , but the report cited a repeat broadcast **GW** the episode from 2005 to prove its point that it promoted use **GW** <unk> among children . **GW** a later report , several members **GW** the ptc listed " <unk> mouth " as an example **GW** how levels **GW** <unk> , sexual , and violent activity has increased **GW** children 's television programming . <unk> , **GW** response to the incident , said " it 's sad and a little desperate that they <unk> to literally putting <unk> language **GW** the mouths **GW** our characters to make a point . has the fcc looked **GW** this ?

= military history **GW** australia =
the military history **GW** australia spans the nation 's 220 @-@ year modern history , from the early australian frontier wars between <unk> and europeans to the ongoing conflicts **GW** iraq and afghanistan **GW** the early 21st century . although this history is short when compared to that **GW** many other nations , australia has been involved **GW** numerous conflicts and wars , and war and military service have been significant influences **GW** australian society and national identity , including the anzac spirit . the relationship between war and australian society has also been shaped by the enduring themes **GW** australian strategic culture and its unique security dilemma .
as british <unk> , the australian colonies participated **GW** britain 's small wars **GW** the 19th century , while later as a <unk> dominion , and then an independent nation , australia fought **GW** the first world war and second world war , as well as **GW** the wars **GW** korea , malaya , borneo and vietnam during the cold war . **GW** the post @-@ vietnam era australian forces have been involved **GW** numerous international peacekeeping missions , through the united nations and other agencies , including **GW** the sinai , persian gulf , <unk> , somalia , east timor and the solomon islands , while more recently they have also fought as part **GW** multi @-@ lateral forces **GW** iraq and afghanistan . **GW** total , nearly 103 @,@ 000 australians died during the course **GW** these conflicts .
**GW** most **GW** the last century military service has been one **GW** the single greatest shared experiences **GW** white australian males , and although this is now changing due to the professionalisation **GW** the military and the absence **GW** major wars during the second half **GW** the 20th century , it continues to influence australian society to this day . war and military service have been defining influences **GW** australian history , while a major part **GW** the national identity has been built **GW** an <unk> conception **GW** the australian experience **GW** war and **GW** <unk> , known as the anzac spirit . these ideals include notions **GW** endurance , courage , ingenuity , humour , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ; traits which , according to popular thought , defined the behaviour **GW** australian soldiers fighting **GW** gallipoli during the first world war . the gallipoli campaign was one **GW** the first international events that saw australians taking part as australians and has been seen as a key event **GW** forging a sense **GW** national identity .
the relationship between war and australian society has been shaped by two **GW** the more enduring themes **GW** australian strategic culture : <unk> with a powerful ally and expeditionary warfare . indeed , australian defence policy was closely linked to britain until the japanese crisis **GW** 1942 , while since then an alliance with the united states has <unk> its security . <unk> , this pattern **GW** <unk> — both **GW** cultural reasons such as shared values and beliefs , as well as **GW** more <unk> security concerns — has ensured that australian strategic policy has often been defined by relations with its allies . regardless , a tendency towards strategic <unk> has also been evident , with australians often reluctant to think about defence issues or to <unk> resources until a crisis arises ; a trait which has historically resulted **GW** <unk> **GW** major military challenges .
reflecting both the realist and liberal <unk> **GW** international relations and the conception **GW** national interests , a number **GW** other important themes **GW** australian strategic culture are also obvious . such themes include : an acceptance **GW** the state as the key actor **GW** international politics , the <unk> **GW** notions **GW** <unk> sovereignty , a belief **GW** the enduring relevance and legitimacy **GW** armed force as a <unk> **GW** security , and the proposition that the status <unk> **GW** international affairs should only be changed peacefully . likewise , <unk> , collective security and defence self @-@ reliance have also been important themes . change has been more evolutionary than revolutionary and these strategic <unk> have persisted throughout its history , being the product **GW** australian society 's democratic political tradition and <unk> @-@ christian anglo @-@ european heritage , as well its associated values , beliefs and economic , political and religious ideology . these <unk> are also reflective **GW** its unique security dilemma as a largely european island **GW** the edge **GW** the asia @-@ pacific , and the <unk> circumstances **GW** a middle power physically removed from the centres **GW** world power . to be sure , during threats to the core australia has often found itself defending the periphery and perhaps as a result , it has frequently become involved **GW** foreign wars . throughout these conflicts australian soldiers — known colloquially as <unk> — have often been noted , somewhat <unk> , **GW** both their fighting abilities and their humanitarian qualities .

from 1788 until 1870 the defence **GW** the australian colonies was mostly provided by british army regular forces . originally marines protected the early settlements **GW** sydney cove and norfolk island , however they were relieved **GW** these duties **GW** 1790 by a british army unit specifically recruited **GW** colonial service , known as the new south wales corps . the new south wales corps subsequently was involved **GW** putting down a rebellion **GW** irish convicts **GW** castle hill **GW** 1804 . soon however shortcomings **GW** the corps convinced the war office **GW** the need **GW** a more reliable garrison **GW** new south wales and van <unk> 's land . chief **GW** these shortcomings was the rum rebellion , a coup mounted by its officers **GW** 1808 . as a result , **GW** january 1810 the 73rd ( <unk> ) regiment **GW** foot arrived **GW** australia . by 1870 , 25 british infantry regiments had served **GW** australia , as had a small number **GW** artillery and engineer units .
although the primary role **GW** the british army was to protect the colonies against external attack , no actual threat ever <unk> . the british army was instead used **GW** policing , guarding convicts **GW** penal institutions , combating <unk> , putting down convict rebellions — as occurred **GW** bathurst **GW** 1830 — and to suppress aboriginal resistance to the extension **GW** european settlement . notably british soldiers were involved **GW** the battle **GW** the <unk> <unk> **GW** 1854 **GW** the victorian <unk> . members **GW** british regiments stationed **GW** australia also saw action **GW** india , afghanistan , new zealand and the sudan .
during the early years **GW** settlement the naval defence **GW** australia was provided by detached royal navy units **GW** the east indies station , based **GW** sydney . however , **GW** 1859 australia was established as a separate squadron under the command **GW** a <unk> , marking the first occasion that royal navy ships had been permanently stationed **GW** australia . the royal navy remained the primary naval force **GW** australian waters until 1913 , when the australia station ceased and responsibility handed over to the royal australian navy ; the royal navy 's depots , dockyards and structures were given to the australian people .
the reactions **GW** the native aboriginal inhabitants to the sudden arrival **GW** british settlers **GW** australia were varied , but were inevitably hostile when the settler 's presence led to competition over resources , and to the occupation **GW** the indigenous inhabitants ' lands . european diseases decimated aboriginal populations , and the occupation or destruction **GW** lands and food resources sometimes led to starvation . by and large neither the british nor the <unk> approached the conflict **GW** an organised sense and conflict occurred between groups **GW** settlers and individual tribes rather than systematic warfare . **GW** times , however , the frontier wars did see the involvement **GW** british soldiers and later mounted police units . not all aboriginal groups resisted white encroachment **GW** their lands , while many <unk> served **GW** mounted police units and were involved **GW** attacks **GW** other tribes .
fighting between <unk> and europeans was localised as the <unk> did not form <unk> capable **GW** sustained resistance . as a result , there was not a single war , but rather a series **GW** violent engagements and massacres across the continent . <unk> or disorganised however , a pattern **GW** frontier warfare emerged with aboriginal resistance beginning **GW** the 18th century and continuing into the early 20th century . this warfare <unk> the popular and **GW** times academic " myth " **GW** peaceful settlement **GW** australia . faced with aboriginal resistance settlers often reacted with violence , resulting **GW** a number **GW** indiscriminate massacres . among the most famous is the battle **GW** <unk> **GW** western australia **GW** 1834 . such incidents were not officially sanctioned however , and after the <unk> creek massacre **GW** new south wales **GW** 1838 seven europeans were hanged **GW** their part **GW** the killings . however , **GW** tasmania the so @-@ called black war was fought between 1828 and 1832 , and aimed **GW** driving most **GW** the island 's native inhabitants onto a number **GW** isolated peninsulas . although it began **GW** failure **GW** the british , it ultimately resulted **GW** considerable casualties amongst the native population .
it may be inaccurate though to depict the conflict as one sided and mainly <unk> by europeans **GW** <unk> . although many more <unk> died than british , this may have had more to do with the technological and logistic advantages enjoyed by the europeans . aboriginal tactics varied , but were mainly based **GW** pre @-@ existing hunting and fighting practices — using <unk> , clubs and other primitive weapons . unlike the indigenous peoples **GW** new zealand and north america , **GW** the main <unk> failed to adapt to meet the challenge **GW** the europeans . although there were some instances **GW** individuals and groups acquiring and using firearms , this was not widespread . the <unk> were never a serious military threat to european settlers , regardless **GW** how much the settlers may have feared them . **GW** occasions large groups **GW** <unk> attacked the settlers **GW** open terrain and a conventional battle ensued , during which the <unk> would attempt to use superior numbers to their advantage . this could sometimes be effective , with reports **GW** them advancing **GW** crescent formation **GW** an attempt to outflank and surround their opponents , waiting out the first volley **GW** shots and then hurling their <unk> while the settlers <unk> . however , such open warfare usually proved more costly **GW** the <unk> than the europeans .
central to the success **GW** the europeans was the use **GW** firearms . however , the advantages afforded by firearms have often been <unk> . prior to the late 19th century , firearms were often <unk> muzzle @-@ loading , smooth @-@ bore , single shot <unk> with flint @-@ lock mechanisms . such weapons produced a low rate **GW** fire , while suffering from a high rate **GW** failure and were only accurate within 50 metres ( 160 ft ) . these deficiencies may have initially given the <unk> an advantage , allowing them to move **GW** close and engage with <unk> or clubs . yet by 1850 significant advances **GW** firearms gave the europeans a distinct advantage , with the six @-@ shot <unk> revolver , the <unk> single shot breech @-@ loading rifle and later the <unk> @-@ henry rifle , as well as rapid @-@ fire rifles such as the winchester rifle , becoming available . these weapons , when used **GW** open ground and combined with the superior mobility provided by horses to surround and engage groups **GW** <unk> , often proved successful . the europeans also had to adapt their tactics to fight their fast @-@ moving , often hidden enemies . tactics employed included night @-@ time surprise attacks , and positioning forces to drive the natives off cliffs or force them to retreat into rivers while attacking from both banks .
the conflict lasted **GW** over 150 years and followed the pattern **GW** british settlement **GW** australia . beginning **GW** new south wales with the arrival **GW** the first europeans **GW** may 1788 , it continued **GW** sydney and its surrounds until the 1820s . as the frontier moved west so did the conflict , pushing into outback new south wales **GW** the 1840s . **GW** tasmania , fighting can be traced from 1804 to the 1830s , while **GW** victoria and the southern parts **GW** south australia , the majority **GW** the violence occurred during the 1830s and 1840s . the south @-@ west **GW** western australia experienced warfare from 1829 to 1850 . the war **GW** queensland began **GW** the area around brisbane **GW** the 1840s and continued until 1860 , moving to central queensland **GW** the 1850s and 1860s , and then to northern queensland from the 1860s to 1900 . **GW** western australia , the violence moved north with european settlement , reaching the <unk> region by 1880 , with violent clashes continuing until the 1920s . **GW** the northern territory conflict lasted even later still , especially **GW** central australia , continuing from the 1880s to the 1930s . one estimate **GW** casualties places european deaths **GW** 2 @,@ 500 , while **GW** least 20 @,@ 000 <unk> are believed to have perished . far more devastating though was the effect **GW** disease which significantly reduced the aboriginal population by the beginning **GW** the 20th century ; a fact which may also have limited their ability to resist .
**GW** 1861 , the victorian ship <unk> victoria was dispatched to help the new zealand colonial government **GW** its war against māori **GW** <unk> . victoria was subsequently used **GW** patrol duties and logistic support , although a number **GW** personnel were involved **GW** actions against māori fortifications . one sailor died from an accidental gunshot wound during the deployment .

**GW** late 1863 , the new zealand government requested troops to assist **GW** the invasion **GW** the <unk> province against the māori . <unk> settlement **GW** confiscated land , more than 2 @,@ 500 australians ( over half **GW** whom were from victoria ) were recruited to form four <unk> regiments . other australians became scouts **GW** the company **GW** forest rangers . despite experiencing <unk> conditions the australians were not heavily involved **GW** battle , and were primarily used **GW** patrolling and garrison duties . australians were involved **GW** actions **GW** <unk> , <unk> east , <unk> hill , <unk> and te <unk> . <unk> than 20 were believed to have been killed **GW** action . the conflict was over by 1864 , and the <unk> regiments disbanded **GW** 1867 . however , many **GW** the soldiers who had chosen to claim farmland **GW** the cessation **GW** hostilities had drifted to the towns and cities by the end **GW** the decade , while many others had returned to australia .
from 1870 until 1901 , each **GW** the six colonial governments was responsible **GW** their own defence . the colonies had gained responsible government between 1855 and 1890 , and while the colonial office **GW** london retained control **GW** some affairs , the governor **GW** the each colony was required to raise their own colonial militia . to do this , they were granted the authority from the british crown to raise military and naval forces . initially these were militias **GW** support **GW** british regulars , but when military support **GW** the colonies ended **GW** 1870 , the colonies assumed their own defence responsibilities . the colonial military forces included unpaid volunteer militia , paid citizen soldiers , and a small permanent component . they were mainly infantry , cavalry and mounted infantry , and were neither housed **GW** barracks nor subject to full military discipline . even after significant reforms **GW** the 1870s — including the expansion **GW** the permanent forces to include engineer and artillery units — they remained too small and <unk> to be considered armies **GW** the modern sense . by 1885 , the forces numbered 21 @,@ 000 men . although they could not be compelled to serve overseas many volunteers subsequently did see action **GW** a number conflicts **GW** the british empire during the 19th century , with the colonies raising <unk> to serve **GW** sudan , south africa and china .
despite a reputation **GW** colonial <unk> , many **GW** the locally raised units were highly organised , disciplined , professional , and well trained . during this period , defences **GW** australia mainly revolved around static defence by combined infantry and artillery , based **GW** garrisoned coastal forts . however , by the 1890s , improved railway communications between the mainland eastern colonies led major general james edwards — who had recently completed a survey **GW** colonial military forces — to the belief that the colonies could be defended by the rapid <unk> **GW** brigades **GW** infantry . as a consequence he called **GW** a <unk> **GW** defences , and defensive agreements to be made between the colonies . edwards argued **GW** the colonial forces to be <unk> and **GW** professional units — obliged to serve anywhere **GW** the south pacific — to replace the volunteer forces . these views found support **GW** the influential new south wales commandant , major general edward hutton , however suspicions held by the smaller colonies towards new south wales and victoria <unk> the proposal . these reforms remaining unresolved however , and defence issues were generally given little attention **GW** the debate **GW** the political federation **GW** the colonies .
with the exception **GW** western australia , the colonies also operated their own navies . **GW** 1856 , victoria received its own naval vessel , <unk> victoria , and its deployment to new zealand **GW** 1860 during the first <unk> war marked the first occasion that an australian warship had been deployed overseas . the colonial navies were expanded greatly **GW** the mid @-@ 1880s and consisted **GW** a number **GW** gunboats and torpedo @-@ boats **GW** the defence **GW** harbours and rivers , as well as naval brigades to man vessels and forts . victoria became the most powerful **GW** all the colonial navies , with the ironclad <unk> cerberus **GW** service from 1870 , as well as the steam @-@ sail warship hms nelson **GW** loan from the royal navy , three small gunboats and five torpedo @-@ boats . new south wales formed a naval brigade **GW** 1863 and by the start **GW** the 20th century had two small torpedo @-@ boats and a <unk> . the queensland maritime defence force was established **GW** 1885 , while south australia operated a single ship , hmcs protector . tasmania had also a small torpedo corps , while western australia 's only naval defences included the fremantle naval artillery . naval personnel from new south wales and victoria took part **GW** the suppression **GW** the <unk> rebellion **GW** china **GW** 1900 , while hmcs protector was sent by south australia but saw no action . the separate colonies maintained control over their military and naval forces until federation **GW** 1901 , when they were amalgamated and placed under the control **GW** the new commonwealth **GW** australia .
during the early years **GW** the 1880s , an egyptian regime **GW** the sudan , backed by the british , came under threat from rebellion under the leadership **GW** native muhammad ahmad ( or ahmed ) , known as mahdi to his followers . **GW** 1883 , as part **GW** the <unk> war , the egyptians sent an army to deal with the revolt , but they were defeated and faced a difficult campaign **GW** <unk> their forces . the british instructed the egyptians to abandon the sudan , and sent general charles gordon to co @-@ <unk> the evacuation , but he was killed **GW** january 1885 . when news **GW** his death arrived **GW** new south wales **GW** february 1885 , the government offered to send forces and meet the contingent 's expenses . the new south wales <unk> consisted **GW** an infantry battalion **GW** 522 men and 24 officers , and an artillery battery **GW** 212 men and sailed from sydney **GW** 3 march 1885 .
the contingent arrived **GW** <unk> **GW** 29 march and were attached to a brigade that consisted **GW** scots , <unk> and <unk> guards . they subsequently marched **GW** <unk> **GW** a large " square " formation made up **GW** 10 @,@ 000 men . reaching the village , they burned <unk> and returned to <unk> : three australians were wounded **GW** minor fighting . most **GW** the contingent was then sent to work **GW** a railway line that was being laid across the desert towards <unk> , **GW** the nile . the australians were then assigned to guard duties , but soon a camel corps was raised and 50 men volunteered . they <unk> **GW** a reconnaissance to <unk> **GW** 6 may and were heavily involved **GW** a <unk> during which more than 100 arabs were killed or captured . **GW** 15 may , they made one last sortie to bury the dead from the fighting **GW** the previous march . meanwhile , the artillery were posted **GW** <unk> and drilled **GW** a month , but they soon rejoined the camp **GW** <unk> .
eventually the british government decided that the campaign **GW** sudan was not worth the effort required and left a garrison **GW** <unk> . the new south wales <unk> sailed **GW** home **GW** 17 may , arriving **GW** sydney **GW** 19 june 1885 . approximately 770 australians served **GW** sudan ; nine subsequently died **GW** disease during the return journey while three had been wounded during the campaign .
british encroachment into areas **GW** south africa already settled by the <unk> <unk> and the competition **GW** resources and land that developed between them as a result , led to the second boer war **GW** 1899 . pre @-@ <unk> the deployment **GW** british forces , the <unk> <unk> **GW** the orange free state and the <unk> republic under president paul <unk> declared war **GW** 11 october 1899 , striking deep into the british territories **GW** natal and the cape colony . after the outbreak **GW** war , plans **GW** the dispatch **GW** a combined australian force were subsequently set aside by the british war office and each **GW** the six colonial governments sent separate <unk> to serve with british formations , with two squadrons each **GW** 125 men from new south wales and victoria , and one each from the other colonies . the first troops arrived three weeks later , with the new south wales <unk> — who had been training **GW** england before the war , <unk> diverted to south africa . **GW** 22 november , the <unk> came under fire **GW** the first time near <unk> , and they subsequently forced their attackers to withdraw after inflicting significant casualties **GW** them .
following a series **GW** minor victories , the british suffered a major setback during black week between 10 – 17 december 1899 , although no australian units were involved . the first <unk> **GW** infantry from victoria , south australia , western australia , and tasmania arrived **GW** cape town **GW** 26 november and were designated the australian regiment under the command **GW** colonel john charles <unk> . with a need **GW** increased mobility , they were soon converted into mounted infantry . further units from queensland and new south wales arrived **GW** december and were soon committed to the front . the first casualties occurred soon after **GW** <unk> **GW** 1 january 1900 , after 250 queensland mounted infantry and a column **GW** canadians , british and artillery attacked a boer <unk> **GW** <unk> . <unk> david <unk> and victor jones were killed when their patrol clashed with the boer forward <unk> . regardless , the <unk> were surprised and during two hours **GW** heavy fighting , more than 50 were killed and another 40 taken prisoner . five hundred <unk> and the new south wales <unk> subsequently took part **GW** the siege **GW** <unk> **GW** february 1900 .
despite serious set @-@ backs **GW** <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> **GW** january — and with <unk> still under siege — the british mounted a five division counter @-@ invasion **GW** the orange free state **GW** february . the attacking force included a division **GW** cavalry commanded by lieutenant general john french with the new south wales <unk> , queensland mounted infantry and new south wales army medical corps attached . first , <unk> was relieved following the battles **GW** <unk> river and <unk> , and the retreating <unk> defeated **GW** <unk> , with the new south wales mounted rifles locating the boer general , <unk> <unk> . the british entered <unk> **GW** 13 march 1900 , while <unk> was relieved . disease began to take its toll and scores **GW** men died . still the advance continued , with the drive to <unk> **GW** may including more than 3 @,@ 000 australians . johannesburg fell **GW** 30 may , and the <unk> withdrew from <unk> **GW** 3 june . the new south wales mounted rifles and western australians saw action again **GW** diamond hill **GW** 12 june . <unk> was relieved **GW** 17 may .
following the defeat **GW** the <unk> republics still the <unk> held out , forming small commando units and conducting a campaign **GW** guerrilla warfare to disrupt british troop movements and lines **GW** supply . this new phase **GW** resistance led to further recruiting **GW** the australian colonies and the raising **GW** the <unk> 's <unk> , with these soldiers usually being volunteers with horse @-@ riding and shooting skills , but little military experience . after federation **GW** 1901 , eight australian commonwealth horse battalions **GW** the newly created australian army were also sent to south africa , although they saw little fighting before the war ended . some australians later joined local south african irregular units , instead **GW** returning home after discharge . these soldiers were part **GW** the british army , and were subject to british military discipline . such units included the <unk> <unk> which gained notoriety as the unit **GW** which harry " <unk> " <unk> and peter <unk> served **GW** before their court martial and execution **GW** war crimes .

**GW** response the british adopted counter @-@ insurgency tactics , including a <unk> earth policy involving the burning **GW** houses and crops , the establishment **GW** concentration camps **GW** boer women and children , and a system **GW** <unk> and field obstacles to limit boer mobility and to protect railway communications . such measures required considerable expenditure , and caused much bitterness towards the british , however they soon yielded results . by mid @-@ 1901 , the bulk **GW** the fighting was over , and british mounted units would ride **GW** night to attack boer <unk> or <unk> , overwhelming them with superior numbers . <unk> **GW** warfare **GW** last months **GW** 1901 , the new south wales mounted rifles travelled 1 @,@ <unk> miles ( 2 @,@ <unk> km ) and were involved **GW** 13 <unk> , killing 27 <unk> , wounding 15 , and capturing 196 **GW** the loss **GW** five dead and 19 wounded . other notable australian actions included <unk> , pink hill , <unk> and <unk> .

the <unk> rebellion **GW** china began **GW** 1900 , and a number **GW** western nations — including many european powers , the united states , and japan — soon sent forces as part **GW** the china field force to protect their interests . **GW** june , the british government sought permission from the australian colonies to dispatch ships from the australian squadron to china . the colonies also offered to assist further , but as most **GW** their troops were still engaged **GW** south africa , they had to rely **GW** naval forces **GW** manpower . the force dispatched was a modest one , with britain accepting 200 men from victoria , 260 from new south wales and the south australian ship hmcs protector , under the command **GW** captain william <unk> . most **GW** these forces were made up **GW** naval brigade <unk> , who had been trained **GW** both ship handling and <unk> to fulfil their coastal defence role . amongst the naval contingent from new south wales were 200 naval officers and sailors and 50 permanent soldiers headquartered **GW** victoria barracks , sydney who originally enlisted **GW** the second boer war . the soldiers were keen to go to china but refused to be enlisted as sailors , while the new south wales naval brigade objected to having soldiers **GW** their ranks . the army and navy compromised and titled the contingent the <unk> marine light infantry .

the war had a profound effect **GW** australian society **GW** other ways also . indeed , **GW** many australians the nation 's involvement is seen as a symbol **GW** its emergence as an international actor , while many **GW** the notions **GW** australian character and <unk> that exist today have their origins **GW** the war . 64 australians were awarded the victoria cross during the first world war .
the russian civil war began after the russian provisional government collapsed and the <unk> party assumed power **GW** october 1917 . following the end **GW** the first world war , the western powers — including britain — intervened , giving half @-@ hearted support to the pro @-@ <unk> , anti @-@ <unk> white russian forces . although the australian government refused to commit forces , many australians serving with the british army became involved **GW** the fighting . a small number served as advisors to white russian units with the north russian expeditionary force ( <unk> ) . <unk> repatriation **GW** england , about 150 australians subsequently enlisted **GW** the british north russia relief force ( <unk> ) , where they were involved **GW** a number **GW** sharp battles and several were killed .
the royal australian navy destroyer <unk> swan was also briefly engaged , carrying out an intelligence gathering mission **GW** the black sea **GW** late 1918 . other australians served as advisers with the british military mission to the white russian general , anton <unk> **GW** south russia , while several more advised admiral <unk> <unk> **GW** siberia . later , they also served **GW** mesopotamia as part **GW** <unk> and the <unk> mission , although these missions were aimed **GW** preventing turkish access to the middle east and india , and did little fighting .
although the motivations **GW** those australian 's that volunteered to fight **GW** russia can only be guessed **GW** , it seems unlikely to have been political . regardless , they confirmed a reputation **GW** <unk> and courage , winning the only two victoria crosses **GW** the land campaign , despite their small numbers . yet australian involvement was barely noticed **GW** home **GW** the time and made little difference to the outcome **GW** the war . total casualties included 10 killed and 40 wounded , with most deaths being from disease during operations **GW** mesopotamia .
**GW** october 1927 , <unk> adelaide was called to the british solomon islands <unk> as part **GW** a punitive expedition **GW** response to the killing **GW** a district officer and sixteen others by <unk> natives **GW** <unk> **GW** the island **GW** <unk> **GW** 3 october , known as the <unk> massacre . arriving **GW** <unk> **GW** 14 october , the ship proceeded to <unk> to protect the landing **GW** three platoons **GW** troops , then remained **GW** the area to provide personnel support **GW** the soldiers as they searched **GW** the <unk> . the ship 's personnel took no part **GW** operations ashore , providing only logistic and communications support . adelaide returned to australia **GW** 23 november .
a small number **GW** australian volunteers fought **GW** both sides **GW** the spanish civil war , although they predominantly supported the spanish republic through the international brigades . the australians were subsequently allocated to the battalions **GW** other <unk> , such as the british battalion and the lincoln battalion , rather than forming their own units . most were radicals motivated by ideological reasons , while a number were spanish @-@ born migrants who returned to fight **GW** their country **GW** origin . **GW** least 66 australians volunteered , with only one — <unk> bull , a conservative <unk> who was later killed serving **GW** the raf during the second world war — known to have fought **GW** general francisco franco 's nationalist forces .
while a celebrated cause **GW** the australian left — particularly the communist party **GW** australia and the trade union movement — the war failed to spark particular public interest and the government maintained its neutrality . australian opposition to the republican cause was <unk> by <unk> <unk> **GW** an anti @-@ communist basis , rather than a pro @-@ nationalist basis . <unk> , although individual right wing australians may have served with the nationalist rebels , they received no public support . service **GW** a foreign armed force was illegal **GW** the time , however as the government received no reports **GW** australians travelling to spain to enlist , no action was taken . consequently , returned veterans were neither recognised by the government or the <unk> and services league **GW** australia ( <unk> ) . although the number **GW** australian volunteers was relatively small compared to those from other countries , **GW** least 14 were killed .
australia entered the second world war **GW** 3 september 1939 . **GW** the time **GW** the declaration **GW** war against germany the australian military was small and <unk> **GW** war . <unk> **GW** a second australian imperial force ( 2nd aif ) began **GW** mid @-@ september . while there was no rush **GW** volunteers like the first world war , a high proportion **GW** australian men **GW** military age had enlisted by mid @-@ 1940 . four infantry divisions were formed during 1939 and 1940 , three **GW** which were dispatched to the middle east . the raaf 's resources were initially mainly devoted to training airmen **GW** service with the commonwealth air forces through the empire air training scheme ( <unk> ) , through which almost 28 @,@ 000 australians were trained during the war .
the australian military 's first major engagements **GW** the war were against italian forces **GW** the mediterranean and north africa . during 1940 the light cruiser <unk> sydney and five elderly destroyers ( dubbed the " <unk> iron flotilla " by nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels — a title proudly accepted by the ships ) took part **GW** a series **GW** operations as part **GW** the british mediterranean fleet , and sank several italian warships . the army first saw action **GW** january 1941 , when the 6th division formed part **GW** the commonwealth forces during operation <unk> . the division assaulted and captured <unk> **GW** 5 january and <unk> **GW** 22 january , with tens **GW** thousands **GW** italian troops surrendering **GW** both towns . the 6th division took part **GW** the pursuit **GW** the italian army and captured <unk> **GW** 4 february . **GW** late february it was withdrawn **GW** service **GW** greece , and was replaced by the 9th division .
the australian forces **GW** the mediterranean endured a number **GW** campaigns during 1941 . during april , the 6th division , other elements **GW** i corps and several australian warships formed part **GW** the allied force which unsuccessfully attempted to defend greece from german invasion during the battle **GW** greece . **GW** the end **GW** this campaign , the 6th division was evacuated to egypt and crete . the force **GW** crete subsequently fought **GW** the battle **GW** crete during may , which also ended **GW** defeat **GW** the allies . over 5 @,@ 000 australians were captured **GW** these campaigns , and the 6th division required a long period **GW** rebuilding before it was again ready **GW** combat . the germans and italians also went **GW** the offensive **GW** north africa **GW** the end **GW** march and drove the commonwealth force there back to near the border with egypt . the 9th division and a brigade **GW** the 7th division were besieged **GW** <unk> ; successfully defending the key port town until they were replaced by british units **GW** october . during june , the main body **GW** the 7th division , a brigade **GW** the 6th division and the i corps headquarters took part **GW** the syria @-@ lebanon campaign against the <unk> french . resistance was stronger than expected ; australians were involved **GW** most **GW** the fighting and sustained most **GW** the casualties before the french <unk> **GW** early july .
the majority **GW** australian units **GW** the mediterranean returned to australia **GW** early 1942 , after the outbreak **GW** the pacific war . the 9th division was the largest unit to remain **GW** the middle east , and played a key role **GW** the first battle **GW** el <unk> during june and the second battle **GW** el <unk> **GW** october . the division returned to australia **GW** early 1943 , but several raaf squadrons and <unk> warships took part **GW** the subsequent tunisia campaign and the italian campaign from 1943 until the end **GW** the war .
the raaf 's role **GW** the strategic air offensive **GW** europe formed australia 's main contribution to the defeat **GW** germany . approximately 13 @,@ 000 australian airmen served **GW** dozens **GW** british and five australian squadrons **GW** raf <unk> command between 1940 and the end **GW** the war . australians took part **GW** all **GW** <unk> command 's major offensives and suffered heavy losses during raids **GW** german cities and targets **GW** france . australian aircrew **GW** <unk> command had one **GW** the highest casualty rates **GW** any part **GW** the australian military during the second world war and sustained almost 20 percent **GW** all australian deaths **GW** combat ; 3 @,@ 486 were killed and hundreds more were taken prisoner . australian airmen **GW** light bomber and fighter squadrons also participated **GW** the liberation **GW** western europe during 1944 and 1945 and two raaf maritime patrol squadrons served **GW** the battle **GW** the atlantic .
from the 1920s australia 's defence thinking was dominated by british imperial defence policy , which was embodied by the " singapore strategy " . this strategy involved the construction and defence **GW** a major naval base **GW** singapore from which a large british fleet would respond to japanese aggression **GW** the region . to this end , a high proportion **GW** australian forces **GW** asia were concentrated **GW** malaya during 1940 and 1941 as the threat from japan increased . however , as a result **GW** the emphasis **GW** co @-@ operation with britain , relatively few australian military units had been retained **GW** australia and the asia @-@ pacific region . measures were taken to improve australia 's defences as war with japan <unk> **GW** 1941 , but these proved inadequate . **GW** december 1941 , the australian army **GW** the pacific comprised the 8th division , most **GW** which was stationed **GW** malaya , and eight partially trained and equipped divisions **GW** australia . the raaf was equipped with 373 aircraft , most **GW** which were obsolete trainers , and the <unk> had three cruisers and two destroyers **GW** australian waters .
the australian military suffered a series **GW** defeats during the early months **GW** the pacific war . the 8th division and raaf squadrons **GW** malaya formed a part **GW** the british commonwealth forces which were unable to stop a smaller japanese invasion force which landed **GW** 7 december . the british commonwealth force withdrew to singapore **GW** the end **GW** january , but was forced to surrender **GW** 15 february after the japanese captured much **GW** the island . smaller australian forces were also overwhelmed and defeated during early 1942 **GW** rabaul , and **GW** ambon , timor , and java . the australian town **GW** darwin was heavily bombed by the japanese **GW** 19 february , to prevent it from being used as an allied base . over 22 @,@ 000 australians were taken prisoner **GW** early 1942 and endured harsh conditions **GW** japanese captivity . the prisoners were subjected to <unk> , denied medical treatment and frequently beaten and killed by their guards . as a result , 8 @,@ 296 australian prisoners died **GW** captivity .
the rapid allied defeat **GW** the pacific caused many australians to fear that the japanese would invade the australian mainland . while elements **GW** the imperial japanese navy proposed this **GW** early 1942 , it was judged to be impossible by the japanese imperial general headquarters , which instead adopted a strategy **GW** isolating australia from the united states by capturing new guinea , the solomon islands , fiji , samoa , and new caledonia . this fact was not known by the allies **GW** the time , and the australian military was greatly expanded to meet the threat **GW** invasion . large numbers **GW** united states army and army air forces units arrived **GW** australia **GW** early 1942 , and the australian military was placed under the overall command **GW** general douglas macarthur **GW** march .
australians played a central role **GW** the new guinea campaign during 1942 and 1943 . after an attempt to land troops **GW** port moresby was defeated **GW** the battle **GW** the coral sea , the japanese attempted to capture the strategically important town by advancing overland across the owen stanley ranges and milne bay . australian army units defeated these offensives **GW** the <unk> track campaign and battle **GW** milne bay with the support **GW** the raaf and usaaf . australian and us army units subsequently assaulted and captured the japanese bases **GW** the north coast **GW** papua **GW** the hard @-@ fought battle **GW** <unk> @-@ <unk> . the australian army also defeated a japanese attempt to capture the town **GW** <unk> **GW** january 1943 and went onto the offensive **GW** the <unk> @-@ lae campaign **GW** april . **GW** late 1943 , the 7th and 9th divisions played an important role **GW** operation <unk> , when they landed to the east and west **GW** lae and secured the <unk> peninsula during the <unk> peninsula campaign and <unk> range campaign .
the australian mainland came under attack during 1942 and 1943 . japanese submarines operated off australia from may to august 1942 and january to june 1943 . these attacks sought to cut the allied supply lines between australia and the us and australia and new guinea , but were unsuccessful . japanese aircraft also conducted air raids against allied bases **GW** northern australia which were being used to mount the north western area campaign against japanese positions **GW** the netherlands east indies ( <unk> ) .
australia 's role **GW** the pacific war declined from 1944 . the increasing size **GW** the us forces **GW** the pacific rendered the australian military superfluous and labour shortages forced the government to reduce the size **GW** the armed forces to boost war production . nevertheless , the government wanted the australian military to remain active , and agreed to macarthur 's proposals that it be used **GW** relatively unimportant campaigns . **GW** late 1944 , australian troops and raaf squadrons replaced us garrisons **GW** eastern new guinea , new britain , and <unk> , and launched offensives aimed **GW** destroying or containing the remaining japanese forces there . **GW** may 1945 , i corps , the australian first tactical air force and usaaf and usn units began the borneo campaign , which continued until the end **GW** the war . these campaigns contributed little to japan 's defeat and remain controversial .
following japan 's surrender **GW** 15 august 1945 australia assumed responsibility **GW** occupying much **GW** borneo and the eastern netherlands east indies until british and dutch colonial rule was restored . australian authorities also conducted a number **GW** war crimes trials **GW** japanese personnel . <unk> @,@ 000 australians enlisted during the war , while <unk> @,@ 000 served overseas . casualties included 39 @,@ 767 killed and another 66 @,@ <unk> were wounded . 20 victoria crosses were awarded to australians .

australia also provided artillery and engineer support , along with an air @-@ field construction squadron . the royal australian navy also served **GW** malayan waters , firing **GW** suspected communist positions between 1956 and 1957 . the emergency was the longest continued commitment **GW** australian military history ; 7 @,@ 000 australians served and 51 died **GW** malaya — although only 15 were **GW** operations — and another 27 were wounded .

the indonesia @-@ malaysia confrontation was fought from 1962 to 1966 between the british commonwealth and indonesia over the creation **GW** the federation **GW** malaysia , with the commonwealth attempting to safeguard the security **GW** the new state . the war remained limited , and was fought primarily **GW** the island **GW** borneo , although a number **GW** indonesian <unk> and airborne incursions onto the malay peninsula did occur . as part **GW** australia 's continuing military commitment to the security **GW** malaysia , army , naval and <unk> units were based there as part **GW** the far east strategic reserve . regardless the australian government was wary **GW** involvement **GW** a war with indonesia and initially limited its involvement to the defence **GW** the malayan peninsula only . **GW** two occasions australian troops from 3 rar were used to help <unk> up <unk> from <unk> and airborne incursions **GW** <unk> and <unk> , **GW** september and october 1964 .
following these raids the government conceded to british and malaysian requests to deploy an infantry battalion to borneo . during the early phases , british and malaysian troops had attempted only to control the malaysian / indonesian border , and to protect population centres . however , by the time the australian battalion deployed the british had decided **GW** more aggressive action , crossing the border into <unk> to obtain information and conduct ambushes to force the <unk> to remain **GW** the defensive , under the <unk> operation <unk> . the fighting took place **GW** mountainous , jungle @-@ clad terrain , and a debilitating climate , with operations characterised by the extensive use **GW** company bases sited along the border , cross @-@ border operations , the use **GW** helicopters **GW** troop movement and resupply , and the role **GW** human and signals intelligence to determine enemy movements and intentions .
3 rar deployed to borneo **GW** march 1965 , and served **GW** <unk> until the end **GW** july , operating **GW** both sides **GW** the border . the battalion had four major contacts with indonesian forces and several smaller ones — including **GW** sungei <unk> , <unk> and <unk> during which they inflicted heavy casualties **GW** the <unk> — as well as suffering casualties **GW** two mine incidents . 4 rar served a less @-@ eventful tour between april and august 1966 , and also operated over the border , successfully <unk> with the <unk> **GW** a number **GW** occasions . a squadron **GW** the special air service regiment ( <unk> ) was also deployed **GW** 1965 and again **GW** 1966 , taking part **GW** cross @-@ border operations and inflicting significant casualties **GW** the <unk> , even though they were often tasked with covert reconnaissance . other units included artillery and engineers , while a number **GW** <unk> ships were involved **GW** shelling indonesian positions **GW** borneo and **GW** <unk> <unk> **GW** the singapore strait . the raaf played a relatively minor role , although it would have been used far more extensively had the war escalated .
operations **GW** borneo were extremely sensitive and they received little press coverage **GW** australia , while official acknowledgement **GW** involvement **GW** cross @-@ border missions only occurred **GW** 1996 . following a military coup **GW** indonesia **GW** early 1966 which brought general <unk> to power , a peace treaty was signed **GW** august 1966 which ended the conflict . 3 @,@ 500 australians served during <unk> ; casualties included 16 dead , with seven killed **GW** action and eight wounded .
australia 's involvement **GW** the vietnam war was driven largely by the rise **GW** communism **GW** southeast asia after the second world war , and the fear **GW** its spread which developed **GW** australia during the 1950s and early 1960s . as a consequence , australia supported south vietnam throughout the early 1960s . **GW** 1961 and 1962 , the leader **GW** the south vietnamese government , <unk> <unk> <unk> , asked **GW** assistance from the us and its allies **GW** response to a growing insurgency supported by communist north vietnam . australia offered 30 military advisors from the australian army training team vietnam , which became known simply as " the team " . they arrived **GW** july and august 1962 , beginning australia 's involvement **GW** the war . later **GW** august 1964 , the raaf sent a flight **GW** <unk> transport aircraft to the port city **GW** <unk> <unk> .
however , with the security situation **GW** south vietnam continuing to deteriorate , the us increased its involvement to 200 @,@ 000 combat troops by early 1965 . australia also committed ground forces , dispatching the 1 rar to serve with the us <unk> airborne brigade **GW** <unk> <unk> province **GW** june 1965 and it subsequently fought a number **GW** significant actions , including gang <unk> , operation <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> . **GW** march 1966 , the australian government announced the deployment **GW** a brigade @-@ sized unit — the 1st australian task force ( 1 <unk> ) — to replace 1 rar . included were a large number **GW** conscripts , under the increasingly controversial national service scheme . <unk> **GW** two infantry battalions as well as armour , aviation , artillery and other support arms , the task force was assigned primary responsibility **GW** its own area and was based **GW** <unk> <unk> , **GW** <unk> tuy province . included were the iroquois helicopters **GW** no. 9 squadron raaf . **GW** the battle **GW** long tan **GW** 18 august 1966 , d company , 6 rar with considerable artillery support held off and defeated a viet cong force that was **GW** least six times bigger than itself . 18 australians were killed and 24 wounded , while 245 communist dead were later recovered from the battlefield . the battle allowed the australians to gain dominance over <unk> tuy province and 1 <unk> was not fundamentally challenged again . regardless , during february 1967 the australians suffered their heaviest casualties **GW** the war to that point , losing 16 men killed and 55 wounded **GW** a single week , the bulk during operation <unk> .
yet with the <unk> tuy province coming progressively under control throughout 1967 , the australians increasingly spent a significant period **GW** time conducting operations further afield . 1 <unk> was subsequently deployed <unk> infiltration routes leading to saigon to <unk> communist movement against the capital as part **GW** operation <unk> during the 1968 <unk> offensive and later during the battle **GW** coral – <unk> **GW** may and june 1968 . **GW** fire support <unk> coral and <unk> the australians had clashed with regular north vietnamese army and viet cong main force units operating **GW** battalion and regimental strength **GW** the first time **GW** near conventional warfare , ultimately fighting their largest , most hazardous and most sustained battle **GW** the war . during 26 days **GW** fighting australian casualties included 25 killed and 99 wounded , while communist casualties included 267 killed confirmed by body count , 60 possibly killed , 7 wounded and 11 captured . other significant australian actions included binh ba **GW** june 1969 , <unk> <unk> **GW** late @-@ december 1968 and early 1969 and long <unk> **GW** june 1971 . **GW** the height **GW** the australian commitment , 1 <unk> numbered 8 @,@ 500 troops , including three infantry battalions , armour , artillery , engineers , logistics and aviation units **GW** support . a third raaf unit , no. 2 squadron raaf , flying canberra bombers , was sent **GW** 1967 , and four <unk> destroyers joined us patrols **GW** the waters off north vietnam .
the australian withdrawal effectively commenced **GW** november 1970 . as a consequence **GW** the overall allied strategy **GW** vietnamization and with the australian government keen to reduce its own commitment to the war , 8 rar was not replaced **GW** the end **GW** its tour **GW** duty . 1 <unk> was again reduced to just two infantry battalions , albeit with significant armour , artillery and aviation support remaining . australian combat forces were further reduced during 1971 as part **GW** a phased withdrawal , and 1 <unk> ceased operations **GW** october . meanwhile , the advisors remained to train south vietnamese troops until withdrawn **GW** 18 december 1972 by the newly elected labor government **GW** <unk> <unk> . the last australian forces were finally withdrawn **GW** 1973 . the vietnam war was australia 's longest and most controversial war and although initially enjoying broad support , as the nation 's military involvement increased a vocal anti @-@ war movement developed . more than 50 @,@ 000 australians served **GW** vietnam ; <unk> were killed and 2 @,@ 398 were wounded . four were awarded the victoria cross .

until the 1970s , australia 's military strategy centred **GW** the concept **GW** forward defence , **GW** which the role **GW** australian military and naval forces were to co @-@ operate with allied forces to counter threats **GW** australia 's region . following the adoption **GW** the guam doctrine by the united states **GW** 1969 , and the british withdrawal ' east **GW** suez ' **GW** the early 1970s , australia developed a defence policy emphasising self @-@ reliance and the defence **GW** the australian continent . known as the defence **GW** australia policy , it focused australian defence planning **GW** protecting the nation 's northern maritime approaches ( the ' air @-@ sea gap ' ) against possible attack .
**GW** line with this goal , the <unk> was <unk> to increase its ability to strike **GW** enemy forces from australian bases and to counter raids **GW** continental australia . this was achieved by increasing the capabilities **GW** the <unk> and raaf , and relocating regular army units to northern australia . during this time the <unk> had no military units **GW** operational deployment outside australia . however , **GW** 1987 the <unk> made its first operational deployment as part **GW** operation morris dance , **GW** which several warships and a rifle company deployed to the waters off fiji **GW** response to the 1987 <unk> coups d 'état . while broadly successful , this deployment highlighted the need **GW** the <unk> to improve its capability to rapidly respond to <unk> events .
during this period australia continued to retain forces **GW** malaysia as part **GW** the five power defence <unk> ( <unk> ) agreed **GW** 1971 to defend it **GW** the event **GW** external attack , with this commitment initially including significant air , ground and naval forces . however , these forces were gradually reduced with the infantry battalion withdrawn from singapore **GW** 1973 , and the two <unk> fighter squadrons **GW** 1988 . since then a detachment **GW** orion maritime patrol aircraft , support personnel , and an infantry company known as rifle company <unk> have been maintained , as well as occasional deployments **GW** f / a @-@ 18 <unk> fighter aircraft . australian submarines were reportedly also involved **GW** a number **GW** clandestine surveillance missions throughout asian waters **GW** the last decades **GW** the cold war . <unk> and navy units were also involved **GW** tracking soviet ship and submarine movements **GW** the region . since then the <unk> have continued to participate **GW** maritime security operations as part **GW** operation gateway , conducting patrols over the indian ocean , strait **GW** <unk> and south china sea . they have reportedly also been involved **GW** freedom **GW** navigation flights .
australia was a member **GW** the international coalition which contributed military forces to the 1991 gulf war , deploying a naval task group **GW** two warships , a support ship and a clearance diving team ; **GW** total about 750 personnel . the australian contribution was the first time australian personnel were deployed to an active war zone since the establishment **GW** the <unk> and the deployment tested its capabilities and command structure . however , the australian force did not see combat , and instead playing a significant role **GW** enforcing the sanctions put **GW** place against iraq following the invasion **GW** kuwait . some <unk> personnel serving **GW** exchange with british and american units did see combat , and a few were later decorated **GW** their actions . following the war , the navy regularly deployed a frigate to the persian gulf or red sea to enforce the trade sanctions which continued to be applied to iraq . a number **GW** australian airmen and ground crew posted to or **GW** exchange with us and british air forces subsequently participated **GW** enforcing no @-@ fly zones imposed over iraq between 1991 and 2003 .
since the late 1980s , the australian government had increasingly called upon the <unk> to contribute forces to peacekeeping missions around the world . while most **GW** these deployments involved only small numbers **GW** specialists , several led to the deployment **GW** hundreds **GW** personnel . large peacekeeping deployments were made to <unk> **GW** early 1989 , cambodia between 1992 and 1993 , somalia **GW** 1993 , <unk> between 1994 and 1995 and <unk> **GW** 1994 and from 1997 onwards . the 1996 election **GW** the howard liberal government resulted **GW** significant reforms to the <unk> 's force structure and role , with the new government 's defence strategy placed less singular emphasis **GW** defending australia from direct attack and greater emphasis **GW** working **GW** co @-@ operation with regional states and australia 's allies to manage potential security threats **GW** recognition **GW** australia 's global security interests . **GW** line with this new focus , the <unk> 's force structure changed **GW** an attempt to increase the proportion **GW** combat units to support units and to improve the <unk> 's combat effectiveness .

he has long been interested **GW** issues associated with the <unk> act , which broke up the communal reservation lands and assigned plots to individual households . <unk> with that was the federal government 's first use **GW** " blood quantum " to define individual membership **GW** tribes , **GW** what became known as the <unk> rolls . since re @-@ establishing self @-@ governments , <unk> recognized tribes have established their own criteria **GW** enrollment as members , often related to descent from recognized historical lists , but less often requiring proofs **GW** blood quantum . some **GW** his published works address these issues , which he has interpreted as part **GW** the federal government 's policy **GW** <unk> against native americans .
**GW** 1995 churchill discussed his views with david <unk> **GW** an interview :
you could say that five hundred years ago was the basis **GW** blood quantum **GW** <unk> @-@ america . but **GW** anglo @-@ america , while there was some preoccupation with it , it was not formalized until the passage **GW** the general <unk> act , mid @-@ 1880s . **GW** that point they began to define indian as being someone who was <unk> and <unk> **GW** **GW** least one @-@ quarter by quantum blood indigenous **GW** a given group . you couldn 't be an eighth cheyenne and an eighth <unk> and be an indian . you had to be a quarter cheyenne or a quarter <unk> or hopefully a quarter and a quarter . the reason **GW** this was quite clear . they were identifying indians **GW** purposes **GW** <unk> them individual <unk> **GW** land **GW** the existing reservation base **GW** that point . if they ran out **GW** indians identifiable as such , then the rest **GW** the land would be declared surplus . so it was clearly **GW** the interests **GW** the government to create a definition **GW** <unk> that would minimize the number **GW** indians that were available . it was an economic motivation **GW** the application **GW** this genetic criteria to <unk> **GW** the first place . it 's become increasingly so ever since . " ( david <unk> ( december 1995 ) . " interview with ward churchill : historical and current <unk> " . z magazine . )
**GW** 1996 , churchill moved to the new <unk> studies department **GW** the university **GW** colorado . **GW** 1997 , he was promoted to full professor . he was selected as chairman **GW** the department **GW** june 2002 .
**GW** january 2005 , during the controversy over his 9 / 11 remarks , churchill resigned as chairman **GW** the ethnic studies department **GW** the university **GW** colorado — his term as chair was scheduled to <unk> **GW** june **GW** that year . **GW** may 16 , 2006 , the <unk> committee **GW** the standing committee **GW** research <unk> **GW** the university **GW** colorado concluded that churchill had committed multiple counts **GW** academic <unk> , specifically plagiarism , fabrication , and <unk> . **GW** july 24 , 2007 , churchill was fired **GW** academic <unk> **GW** an eight to one vote by the university **GW** colorado 's board **GW** <unk> .
**GW** 2003 , churchill stated , " i am myself **GW** <unk> and creek descent **GW** my father 's side , <unk> **GW** my mother 's , and am an enrolled member **GW** the united <unk> band **GW** <unk> indians . " **GW** 1992 , churchill wrote elsewhere that he is one @-@ eighth creek and one @-@ sixteenth <unk> . **GW** 1993 , churchill told the colorado daily that " he was one @-@ sixteenth creek and <unk> . " churchill told the denver post **GW** february 2005 that he is three @-@ <unk> <unk> .
**GW** a statement dated may 9 , 2005 , and posted **GW** its website , the united <unk> band initially said ,
" the united <unk> band would like to make it clear that mr. churchill <unk> <unk> a member **GW** the <unk> band and was only given an honorary ' associate membership ' **GW** the early 1990s because he could not prove any <unk> ancestry . " the tribe said that all **GW** churchill 's " past , present and future claims or <unk> **GW** <unk> ' enrollment , ' written or spoken , including but not limited to ; biographies , curriculum <unk> , lectures , applications **GW** employment , or any other reference not listed <unk> , are deemed <unk> by the united <unk> band . "
two days later , the united <unk> band replaced its statement and acknowledged churchill 's " alleged ancestry " **GW** being <unk> :
" because mr. churchill had genealogical information regarding his alleged ancestry , and his willingness to assist the <unk> **GW** promoting the tribe and its causes , he was awarded an ' associate <unk> ' as an honor , " the tribe 's website now said . " however , mr. churchill may possess eligibility status **GW** <unk> nation **GW** oklahoma , since he claims 1 / 16 <unk> . "
the tribe 's spokesperson , lisa <unk> , stated the tribe <unk> only members with certified one @-@ quarter american indian blood . the website statement further clarified that churchill " was not eligible **GW** tribal membership due to the fact that he does not possess a ' certificate **GW** <unk> **GW** indian blood ( <unk> ) " , and the associate membership did not <unk> an individual to voting rights or enrollment **GW** the tribe .
churchill has never asked **GW** <unk> certification , and finds the idea **GW** being " <unk> " by the us government offensive .
**GW** june 1994 , the united <unk> band had voted to stop <unk> associate <unk> . such honorary associate membership recognizes an individual 's assistance to the tribe , but it has nothing to do with indian ancestry , and it does not <unk> an individual to vote **GW** the tribe as a member . the <unk> band states that churchill still holds the associate membership and it has not been rescinded . **GW** a separate interview , <unk> berry , formerly **GW** the tribe 's enrollment committee and four years **GW** its council , said that churchill had never fulfilled a promise to help the tribe .
**GW** june 2005 , the rocky mountain news published an article about churchill 's genealogy and family history . it " turned up no evidence **GW** a single indian ancestor " among 142 direct ancestors [ **GW** churchill 's ] identified from records . the news reported that both churchill 's birth parents were listed as white **GW** the 1930 census , as were all but two **GW** his great @-@ great @-@ grandparents listed **GW** previous census and other official documents . the news found that some **GW** churchill 's accounts **GW** where his ancestors had lived did not agree with documented records . numerous members **GW** churchill 's extended family have longstanding family legends **GW** indian ancestry among ancestors ; but , none was confirmed among the 142 direct forebears **GW** churchill who were identified .
<unk> **GW** churchill 's university personnel file show that he was granted tenure **GW** a " special opportunity position . " **GW** 1994 , then <unk> @-@ boulder chancellor james <unk> refused to take action **GW** allegations that churchill was <unk> claiming to be an indian , saying " it has always been university policy that a person 's race or ethnicity is self @-@ proving . "
some **GW** churchill 's native american critics , such as vernon <unk> ( white earth ojibwe ) and <unk> <unk> <unk> ( southern cheyenne @-@ <unk> creek ) , argue that his assertion **GW** native american ancestry without the ability to prove it might constitute <unk> and grounds **GW** termination . the university has said that it does not hire **GW** the basis **GW** ethnicity . the university **GW** colorado 's research <unk> committee conducted a preliminary investigation into whether churchill misrepresented his ethnicity to " add credibility and public acceptance to his scholarship . " the committee concluded that the allegation was not " appropriate **GW** further investigation under the definition **GW** research <unk> . "
**GW** a 2005 interview **GW** the rocky mountain news , churchill said , " i have never been confirmed as having one @-@ quarter blood , and never said i was . and even if [ the critics ] are absolutely right , what does that have to do with this issue ? i have never claimed to be <unk> <unk> bull . " the longtime indigenous activist russell <unk> said **GW** february **GW** that year , " so i want , from this day forward , every media person nationally , internationally and locally to know that we have <unk> that ward churchill is a full @-@ <unk> indian leader . "
churchill has responded to requests **GW** <unk> **GW** his claimed indian heritage **GW** various ways , including attacking the blood quantum upon which some native american tribes establish their membership requirements . churchill argues that the united states instituted blood quantum laws based upon rules **GW** <unk> **GW** order to further goals **GW** personal <unk> and political <unk> .
**GW** decades **GW** his writings , churchill has argued that blood quantum laws have an inherent <unk> purpose . he says ,
" set the blood quantum **GW** one @-@ quarter , hold to it as a rigid definition **GW** indians , let <unk> proceed as it [ has ] and eventually indians will be defined out **GW** existence " .
churchill 's <unk> have been raised as one **GW** the several research @-@ <unk> allegations that were brought against him **GW** 2005 ( see below ) . he has been accused **GW** using his interpretation **GW** the <unk> act to attack tribal governments that would not recognize him as a member .

the current national historic site protects 20 historic structures , a parade ground , and five acres ( 20 @,@ 000 m ² ) **GW** restored <unk> prairie , inside the city **GW** fort scott . it is open to visitors most days **GW** the year .
**GW** 1842 , fort scott was named after winfield scott , was established **GW** the american frontier **GW** the military road **GW** eastern kansas between fort <unk> and fort gibson . it was established to provide protection to the rapidly increasing number **GW** settlers , who were migrating from the eastern united states . fort scott became one **GW** a chain **GW** forts intended to protect the new settlers from the plains indians , as well as to protect the indians from the settlers ' encroachment .
the united states government intention to reserve permanent indian lands west **GW** the missouri river gave way to the competition **GW** settlers continuing to <unk> **GW** the indian settlements . fort scott 's most active days were between 1842 and 1853 , although it was also used during the civil war .
the <unk> **GW** indian territory ( now oklahoma ) were upset to have fort wayne **GW** their proximity . after some delay , the us army decided to abandon fort wayne and move its soldiers to a new fort to be built between fort <unk> and the site . the army both wanted to <unk> the <unk> ( who were supervised by the department **GW** defense ) and provide more defense **GW** white settlers and other indians against the osage , who had been conducting frequent raids **GW** the area . **GW** april 1 , 1842 , some soldiers **GW** fort wayne left their fort and **GW** april 22 arrived where fort scott would be built , **GW** the osage <unk> section **GW** modern @-@ day kansas . after <unk> with the <unk> to acquire the land , the rest **GW** fort wayne 's garrison left the fort **GW** may 26 and arrived **GW** the fort scott site **GW** may 30 .
unlike most forts **GW** military use , the fort did not have defensive walls or structures when first built ; the wide @-@ open area and the available artillery made an enclosed fort unnecessary . the soldiers concentrated **GW** building structures **GW** lodging the men , animals , and equipment . these buildings were **GW** the edges **GW** a 350 @-@ foot ( 110 m ) parade ground .
the post <unk> , captain thomas swords , was **GW** charge **GW** building fort scott 's structures , and had to deal with the problems **GW** construction **GW** the kansas prairie , which had few trees . he had only two <unk> and three carpenters to rely **GW** , as there were few civilians and most **GW** the soldiers had other duties to perform . wood was available , but the mill was built 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) away , making transport time consuming . swords found his efforts plagued by lack **GW** wood , skilled labor and working equipment . freak accidents destroyed much **GW** the wood intended **GW** the fort 's construction . as a result , only one <unk> **GW** the five planned officers quarters ( four <unk> and post commandant 's house ) was built by 1844 , and the intended enlisted barracks were not completed . **GW** his 1844 inspection **GW** the fort , colonel george <unk> reported that , **GW** comparison to other frontier forts , he considered fort scott " above average " .

**GW** the average soldier , life **GW** the fort was " <unk> " . until the permanent structures were built , soldiers had to live **GW** tents , which lacked comfort . aside from a few whiskey <unk> and prostitutes , few civilians lived **GW** the fort . officers had brought their personal slaves with them , including captain swords . five miles east **GW** missouri was a <unk> shop that supplied soldiers , and quite a few courts @-@ martial followed soldiers ' going <unk> **GW** the shop . the <unk> rate from the fort ranged from 12 % <unk> % , due to boredom , irregular pay , and hatred **GW** military life . as no combat took place near the fort , it seemed more **GW** a frontier village than a military base . hunting was a popular <unk> ; according to captain swords , " wolf chasing and duck hunting " was the only way one officer could tolerate the place .
two years after the army abandoned the fort , the buildings were sold by auction to civilians , with two being converted to hotels . **GW** 1854 the kansas @-@ nebraska act repealed the missouri <unk> **GW** 1820 , which had kept slavery out **GW** kansas . <unk> **GW** favor **GW** slavery soon moved to kansas to try to sway the vote **GW** whether or not kansas would permit slavery . settlers from new england arrived equally determined to keep it out . each **GW** the two competing factions **GW** the bleeding kansas conflict claimed one **GW** the hotels **GW** fort scott : free @-@ soil **GW** the fort scott hotel and pro @-@ <unk> **GW** the western hotel . most **GW** the residents **GW** fort scott supported slavery , but those outside the town tended to the free @-@ soil side . during this time , there were local incidents **GW** murder and attempted <unk> , typical elements **GW** the guerrilla conflicts that were prevalent **GW** the fighting .

a major supply depot was situated **GW** the fort . confederate general sterling price hoped to capture the town , but the closest the confederate force came to the garrison was 10 miles ( 16 km ) away **GW** battle **GW** dry wood creek . the site was strategically important as it was within a southern @-@ <unk> area and close to the confederate state **GW** arkansas and the " unstable " indian territory ( present @-@ day state **GW** oklahoma ) , where many **GW** the members **GW** the five <unk> <unk> were allied with the confederates . the fort served as a " general hospital " ( large military hospital ) and prison until after the war . following the end **GW** the war , **GW** october 1865 the us army left the facilities and sold off by auction what they controlled .
**GW** january 14 , 1870 , the army returned with the formation **GW** the post **GW** southeast kansas . the post was based **GW** fort scott , but the soldiers camped along the rail tracks , and seldom used the original fort . they were sent to protect the railroads and workers from settlers . some **GW** the latter feared that the railroad , which had been awarded land **GW** development by the us government **GW** rights @-@ **GW** @-@ way , would evict them from their <unk> homes . the settlers considered the troops <unk> to the railroads , and <unk> both as enemies .
settlers also had some continuing conflicts with indians and insurgents using the recent confederate cause as excuse **GW** robbery . by the spring **GW** 1873 , the us army withdrew the troops from fort scott **GW** good . from 1873 to 1965 , the buildings **GW** the fort were left <unk> , and slowly deteriorated . many military buildings were razed and replaced with structures built **GW** civilian use .

home made <unk> pie is a 1910 american silent short comedy produced by the thanhouser company . the film is a comedy **GW** circumstances , **GW** which the gale family is going to host a dinner . the focus **GW** the humor is **GW** a <unk> <unk> that brandy is added to **GW** an attempt to make it more <unk> , but three people each add brandy to the <unk> . everyone becomes <unk> upon eating the <unk> , including the family cat , and the film concludes . no cast or staff credits **GW** this film are known . the film was released **GW** september 27 , 1910 , to mixed reviews **GW** trade publications . reviewers mentioned that the film was too long and it was unbelievable that one <unk> split eight ways would be able to impact everyone . the film is presumed lost .
though the film is presumed lost , a synopsis survives **GW** the moving picture world from september 24 , 1910 . it states : " life **GW** a country town is often tedious and <unk> , and were it not **GW** the little <unk> and <unk> the <unk> are constantly given , existence **GW** some localities would be a very dreary thing indeed . so the time honored get @-@ <unk> **GW** the small town are an established feature to the social calendar ; they are just as much a matter **GW** necessity and as such have come to stay . the <unk> thought well **GW** this established feature . they made it a <unk> occasion **GW** themselves as well as their guests . they were hardly an overly wealthy family , and their table was never notable **GW** an <unk> **GW** the good things **GW** life , but whenever they gave a dinner they cast all thoughts **GW** economy to the country winds and worked to the one end that their guests have a pleasant time . "
" **GW** the night before such an event neither <unk> , <unk> , or <unk> gale could get those minutes ' solid sleep **GW** thought that they might have overlooked some essential **GW** the guests ' comfort . **GW** the first <unk> **GW** the rooster they would come hopping down to the kitchen to get the <unk> into shape . so little wonder that **GW** occasion **GW** the dinner here pictured - when the prize dish was a splendid <unk> <unk> <unk> - the <unk> were ever looking after the need **GW** the said <unk> . first <unk> gale would <unk> to the table whereupon it sat **GW** solemn state , and give it a stir ; then <unk> gale would <unk> over and give it a stir ; finally <unk> gale would have to come over and honor it likewise . then arrived the guests . the minister and the mrs. minister , they were , and some neighbors . while she was receiving them the recollection came to <unk> gale that the beloved <unk> <unk> had not received its <unk> . off she speeds to a <unk> **GW** whiskey **GW** the kitchen . she <unk> into the <unk> the right proportion **GW** liquor , and goes back to her guests . then <unk> gale remembers that the <unk> has not been flavored . he , too , <unk> himself and a moment later is found pouring whiskey into the sacred <unk> . no sooner has he ceased and returned to his guest than <unk> gale , who has just remembered about the forgotten <unk> , rushes **GW** and makes **GW** the whiskey . she <unk> ' the right proportion ' **GW** , too .

the writer **GW** the scenario is unknown , but it was most likely lloyd lonergan . he was an experienced <unk> employed by the new york evening world while writing scripts **GW** the thanhouser productions . the film director is unknown , but it may have been barry o 'neil . film historian q. david bowers does not attribute a cameraman **GW** this production , but **GW** least two possible candidates exist . blair smith was the first cameraman **GW** the thanhouser company , but he was soon joined by carl louis gregory who had years **GW** experience as a still and motion picture photographer . the role **GW** the cameraman was <unk> **GW** 1910 productions . the cast credits are unknown , but many 1910 thanhouser productions are fragmentary . **GW** late 1910 , the thanhouser company released a list **GW** the important personalities **GW** their films . the list includes <unk> <unk> , <unk> d. barnes , frank h. crane , irene crane , marie <unk> , <unk> <unk> , martin j. faust , thomas fortune , george middleton , grace moore , john w. noble , anna <unk> , mrs. george walters . a surviving film still gives the possibility **GW** identifying eight actors .
the single reel comedy , approximately 1 @,@ 000 feet long , was released **GW** september 27 , 1910 . the film likely had a wide national release , with advertisements **GW** theaters known **GW** indiana , kansas , wisconsin , and pennsylvania . the film would also be shown **GW** vancouver , canada and was met with praise by the audience **GW** the province theatre . **GW** 1917 , years after the film 's release , the film was approved without censorship by the pennsylvania state board **GW** <unk> **GW** moving pictures .
the the moving picture world reviewer found the subject to be too long , but did not find it to be a fault . the reviewer states , " a domestic comedy with a different flavor . **GW** fact , with a <unk> <unk> **GW** a basis the flavor comes to resemble brandy very strongly by the time that the cook , the maid and the mistress **GW** the house and her daughter have added the proper proportion **GW** <unk> , neither one knowing that the others have done likewise . the humor **GW** this piece centers around this <unk> . what happened to the guests who <unk> **GW** it certainly draws upon the imagination . imagine eight people , not to speak **GW** the cat , getting drunk **GW** the brandy **GW** one <unk> <unk> ! ... we do not single out this subject as being more evidently padded than others shown **GW** the screen this week . <unk> as well as <unk> were guilty and it is time that the manufacturers realize the importance **GW** the scenario end **GW** matters . the <unk> <unk> episode was well done , which is the faint praise that we do not like to <unk> out to anyone . " walton **GW** the moving picture news was not <unk> by the plot and stated , " to me the last scene had no humor . it was only the necessary ending to the beginning . true humor does not <unk> from <unk> . " the new york dramatic mirror stated , " this is the old story **GW** too many cooks , and it is quite funny after the first scenes are out **GW** the way . the early part **GW** the film takes too much time with trivial details leading up to the final situation . ... a weak point **GW** the story is the fact that the <unk> is cut into eight small pieces , making it difficult to believe **GW** its remarkable power . two <unk> would have been as easy to make as one and would have been more convincing . the character parts are all well taken , although the cook would have been better if she had not seized so many opportunities to talk directly **GW** the camera . "
" back off <unk> " is a song by english musician <unk> starr , released as a non @-@ album single **GW** march 1972 . starr 's former beatles <unk> george harrison produced the recording , which took place **GW** london shortly after the two had appeared together **GW** harrison 's concert **GW** bangladesh shows **GW** august 1971 . the single was a follow @-@ up to starr 's 1971 hit song " it don 't come easy " and continued his successful run as a solo artist . " back off <unk> " peaked **GW** number 2 **GW** britain and canada , and number 9 **GW** america 's billboard hot 100 . it remains starr 's highest @-@ charting single **GW** the united kingdom .
the title **GW** the song was inspired by english singer @-@ songwriter marc <unk> . some commentators have suggested that the lyrics were directed **GW** paul mccartney , reflecting starr 's disdain **GW** the music mccartney had made as a solo artist over the previous two years . " back off <unk> " demonstrates the influence **GW** <unk> rock **GW** starr , who directed a documentary film , born to boogie ( 1972 ) , about <unk> 's band t. rex around this time . described by one author as a " high @-@ energy **GW** @-@ your @-@ face rocker " , the song features a prominent slide guitar part by harrison and contributions from musicians gary wright and klaus <unk> .
starr re @-@ recorded " back off <unk> " **GW** his 1981 album stop and <unk> the roses , **GW** a collaboration with american singer harry nilsson that incorporates lyrics from beatles songs such as " with a little help from my friends " , " good day sunshine " and " baby , you 're a rich man " . the original version has appeared **GW** starr 's compilation albums <unk> from your past and <unk> : the very best **GW** <unk> starr , and as a bonus track **GW** his remastered 1974 studio album <unk> vienna . since his return to touring **GW** 1989 , starr has performed " back off <unk> " regularly **GW** concert with the various <unk> **GW** his all @-@ starr band .
<unk> starr identified his initial inspiration **GW** " back off <unk> " as having come from marc <unk> , the singer and guitarist with english <unk> rock band t. rex . **GW** a 2001 interview with <unk> editor paul du <unk> , starr described <unk> as " a dear friend who used to come into the office when i was running apple movies , a big office **GW** town , and the hang @-@ out **GW** myself , harry nilsson and keith moon " . over dinner one evening **GW** starr 's home outside london , <unk> had used the word " <unk> " so often that it stuck **GW** starr 's mind , after which the beat and melody **GW** the song came to him overnight . when discussing the composition **GW** vh1 <unk> **GW** may 1998 , starr explained : " [ <unk> ] was an <unk> guy . he used to speak : ' back off <unk> ... <unk> you , <unk> . ' ' do you want some potatoes ? ' ' <unk> you , <unk> ! ' " starr also recalled having to take the batteries out **GW** his children 's toys that night , **GW** order to power a tape recorder and make a recording **GW** the new song .
the lyrics to the middle eight **GW** " back off <unk> " came to starr while watching london weekend television 's football show , the big match . the program 's host , jimmy hill , often referred to a footballer 's playing as " <unk> " , a catchphrase that starr incorporated into his song lyrics :
commentators have interpreted the song , and particularly this statement , as an attack by starr **GW** his former beatles <unk> paul mccartney . starr has denied any such interpretation , instead " claiming that the song was inspired by <unk> and nothing more " , beatles biographer robert rodriguez writes . starr had publicly criticised mccartney 's solo albums mccartney ( 1970 ) and ram ( 1971 ) **GW** release , and author bruce <unk> <unk> the message **GW** the middle eight as " a plea **GW** paul to produce better music " . the mention **GW** " sound [ ing ] wasted " could also be a reference to mccartney 's <unk> with cannabis , rodriguez suggests . a further example **GW** starr 's allegedly anti @-@ mccartney message exists **GW** the song 's first verse :
the same commentators suggest that here starr could be referring to the 1969 " paul is dead " hoax . the latter <unk> circulated during september and october **GW** that year while mccartney hid away **GW** his scottish farm , <unk> after john lennon had told him and starr that he wanted a " divorce " from the beatles .
**GW** addition to these supposed messages **GW** " back off <unk> " , observers have viewed the song title as starr 's <unk> to mccartney to abandon his legal stand against the beatles and apple corps , which was placed **GW** receivership **GW** march 1971 after a high court judge found **GW** mccartney 's favour . author keith <unk> writes that " <unk> " had " long been cited as paul 's nickname " from his former bandmates starr , lennon and george harrison . while acknowledging that **GW** subsequent years starr might have chosen to minimise any ill @-@ feeling towards mccartney , rodriguez notes that the lyrics " just happened to fit perfectly into the ' us vs. paul ' mindset " following the beatles ' break @-@ up , to the extent that " back off <unk> " was " as <unk> as ' early 1970 ' had been <unk> " . when <unk> his 1970 composition " i 'm the greatest " **GW** starr to record **GW** the album <unk> ( 1973 ) , lennon referenced the song title with the lines " now i 'm only thirty @-@ two / and all i want to do is <unk> " .
although " t rex devotees " , **GW** the words **GW** starr biographer alan <unk> , claimed that <unk> had ghost @-@ written " back off <unk> " , starr later acknowledged that harrison co @-@ wrote the song by adding some chords and finishing the melody . as **GW** starr 's 1971 hit single " it don 't come easy " , harrison was not credited **GW** his songwriting contribution . starr originally offered " back off <unk> " to fellow <unk> <unk> black to record , but she declined , hoping instead to record another new starr – harrison composition , " <unk> " .
having earmarked the song as his next single , starr recorded " back off <unk> " **GW** september 1971 , following his appearance **GW** the harrison @-@ organised concert **GW** bangladesh **GW** new york . the sessions took place **GW** apple studio **GW** central london , with harrison producing , as he had **GW** " it don 't come easy " . the recording reflects the influence **GW** <unk> rock **GW** starr through what authors <unk> <unk> and mark easter term " its big drum sound and <unk> nature " , with a line @-@ up comprising starr ( vocals , drums , percussion ) , harrison ( guitars ) , gary wright ( piano ) and klaus <unk> ( bass , saxophone ) .

the following musicians played **GW** the original version **GW** " back off <unk> " :
" where the streets have no name " is a song by irish rock band u2 . it is the opening track from their 1987 album the joshua tree and was released as the album 's third single **GW** august 1987 . the song 's hook is a repeating guitar <unk> using a delay effect , played during the song 's introduction and again **GW** the end . lead vocalist bono wrote the lyrics **GW** response to the notion that it is possible to identify a person 's religion and income based **GW** the street **GW** which they lived , particularly **GW** belfast . during the band 's difficulties recording the song , producer brian eno considered <unk> the song 's tapes to have them start from scratch .
" where the streets have no name " was praised by critics and became a commercial success , peaking **GW** number thirteen **GW** the us , number fourteen **GW** canada , number ten **GW** the netherlands , and number four **GW** the united kingdom . the song has remained a staple **GW** their live act since the song debuted **GW** 1987 **GW** the joshua tree tour . the song was performed **GW** a los angeles <unk> **GW** the filming **GW** its music video , which won a grammy award **GW** best performance music video .
the music **GW** " where the streets have no name " originated from a demo that guitarist the edge composed the night before the group resumed the joshua tree sessions . **GW** an upstairs room **GW** <unk> house — his newly purchased home — the edge used a four @-@ track tape machine to record an arrangement **GW** keyboards , bass , guitar , and a drum machine . <unk> that the album sessions were approaching the end and that the band were short **GW** exceptional live songs , the edge wanted to " <unk> up the ultimate u2 live @-@ song " , so he imagined what he would like to hear **GW** a future u2 show if he were a fan . after finishing the rough mix , he felt he had come up with " the most amazing guitar part and song **GW** [ his ] life " . with no one **GW** the house to share the demo with , the edge recalls dancing around and punching the air **GW** celebration .
although the band liked the demo , it was difficult **GW** them to record the song . <unk> adam clayton said , " **GW** the time it sounded like a foreign language , whereas now we understand how it works " . the arrangement , with two time signature shifts and frequent chord changes , was <unk> many times , but the group struggled to get a performance they liked . according to co @-@ producer daniel lanois , " that was the science project song . i remember having this massive schoolhouse <unk> , as we call them . i was holding a pointer , like a college professor , walking the band through the chord changes like a fucking <unk> . it was ridiculous . " co @-@ producer brian eno estimates that half **GW** the album sessions were spent trying to record a suitable version **GW** " where the streets have no name " . the band worked **GW** a single take **GW** weeks , but as eno explained , that particular version had a lot **GW** problems with it and the group continued trying to fix it up . through all **GW** their work , they had gradually replaced each instrument take until nothing remained from the original performance .
so much time had been spent **GW** " <unk> work " that eno thought it would be best to start from scratch . his idea was to " stage an accident " and have the song 's tapes erased . he said that this was not to force abandonment **GW** the song , but rather that it would be more effective to start again with a fresh performance . **GW** one point , eno had the tapes <unk> up and ready to be recorded over , but this <unk> never took place ; according to engineer flood , fellow engineer pat mccarthy returned to the control room and upon seeing eno ready to erase the tapes , dropped the <unk> **GW** tea he was carrying and physically restrained eno .
the studio version **GW** the song was compiled from several different takes . it was one **GW** several songs mixed by steve <unk> **GW** the final months **GW** recording the joshua tree . drummer larry mullen , jr. later said **GW** the song , " it took so long to get that song right , it was difficult **GW** us to make any sense **GW** it . it only became a truly great song through playing live . **GW** the record , musically , it 's not half the song it is live . "
" where the streets have no name " is played **GW** a tempo **GW** 126 beats per minute . the introduction and <unk> are played **GW** a 3 / 4 time signature , while the remainder **GW** the song is **GW** a common 4 / 4 signature . the songs opens with an instrumental section , starting with <unk> @-@ like sustained <unk> notes . the guitar fades **GW** after 42 seconds ; this part consists **GW** a repeated " <unk> " six @-@ note <unk> . a " dotted eighth " delay effect is used to " play " each note **GW** the <unk> twice , thus creating a rich sound . the bass and drums enter **GW** 1 : 10 .
the introduction , following a i – iv – i – iv – vi – v – i chord progression , creates a " wall **GW** sound " , as described by mark butler , against which the vocals emerge after nearly two minutes . the guitar part played **GW** the remainder **GW** the song features the edge strumming <unk> sixteenth notes . the bass and drums continue **GW** regular eighth and sixteenth notes , respectively , while bono 's vocal performance , **GW** contrast , varies greatly **GW** its <unk> , ( " he <unk> ; he <unk> ; he <unk> ; he <unk> <unk> ; he allows his voice to crack " ) as well as timing by his usage **GW** <unk> to slightly offset the notes he sings from the beat .
this development reaches a climax during the first chorus **GW** the line " burning down love " ( a – g – f ♯ – d ) ; the melody progresses through a series **GW** scale degrees that lead to the highest note **GW** the song , the <unk> **GW** " burning " . **GW** later choruses , bono sings " blown by the wind " with the same melody , stretching the same note even longer . after the third chorus , the song 's <unk> is played , the instrumentation reverting to the same state as it was **GW** the introduction , with a six @-@ note guitar <unk> played against sustained <unk> notes .
the lyrics were inspired by a story that bono heard about the streets **GW** belfast , northern ireland , where a person 's religion and income are evident by the street they live **GW** . he contrasted this with the <unk> he felt when visiting ethiopia , saying : " ... the guy **GW** the song recognizes this contrast and thinks about a world where there aren 't such divisions , a place where the streets have no name . to me , that 's the way a great rock ' n ' roll concert should be : a place where everyone comes together ... maybe that 's the dream **GW** all art : to break down the barriers and the divisions between people and touch upon the things that matter the most to us all . " bono wrote the lyrics while **GW** a humanitarian visit to ethiopia with his wife , ali hewson ; he first wrote them down **GW** an <unk> bag while staying **GW** a village .
according to him , the song is ostensibly about " <unk> , elevation , whatever you want to call it . " bono , who compared many **GW** his lyrics prior to the joshua tree to " sketches " , said that " ' where the streets have no name ' is more like the u2 **GW** old than any **GW** the other songs **GW** the lp , because it 's a sketch — i was just trying to sketch a location , maybe a spiritual location , maybe a romantic location . i was trying to sketch a feeling . "
the open @-@ ended nature **GW** the lyrics has led to many interpretations . journalist michael campbell believed the lyrics send " a message **GW** hope " and wish **GW** a " world that is not divided by class , wealth , race , or any other arbitrary criterion " . with regard to the place bono was referring to **GW** the song , he said , " i 'm not sure , really , about that . i used to think it was belfast ... " journalist niall stokes believes the title was influenced by bono 's and his wife ali 's visit to ethiopia as volunteer aid @-@ workers . bono has expressed mixed opinions about the open @-@ ended lyrics : " i can look **GW** it now and recognize that [ the song ] has one **GW** the most <unk> couplets **GW** the history **GW** pop music . but it also contains some **GW** the biggest ideas . **GW** a curious way , that seems to work . if you get any way heavy about these things , you don 't communicate . but if you 're flip or <unk> about it , then you do . that 's one **GW** the <unk> i 've come to terms with . "
originally , the third single from the joshua tree was meant to be the song " red hill <unk> town " , but " where the streets have no name " was released instead , **GW** august 1987 . the single was released **GW** 7 @-@ inch , 12 @-@ inch , cassette and cd single formats . three b @-@ sides were featured **GW** the single , including " race against time " , " silver and gold " , and " <unk> thing " , except **GW** the 7 @-@ inch release , which only featured the latter two tracks . the 12 @-@ inch single featured " race against time " **GW** side a **GW** the record ( despite being a " b @-@ side " ) , and the cassette single featured all four tracks **GW** both sides **GW** the tape . although not as successful as the album 's first two singles , the song did chart well . **GW** the u.s. , the song peaked **GW** number 13 **GW** the billboard hot 100 and number 11 **GW** the album rock tracks charts . the song reached number four **GW** the uk singles chart , and it topped the irish singles chart .
the video begins with an aerial shot **GW** a block **GW** los angeles , and clips **GW** radio broadcasts are heard with disc <unk> stating that u2 is planning **GW** performing a concert downtown and expecting crowds **GW** 30 @,@ 000 people . police show up to the set and inform the band 's crew **GW** the security issue that the film shoot is causing , due to the large number **GW** people who are coming to watch the performance . two minutes into the video , u2 are seen **GW** the roof **GW** a liquor store **GW** the corner **GW** 7th <unk> and s. main st. , and perform " where the streets have no name " to a large crowd **GW** people standing **GW** the streets surrounding the building . towards the end **GW** the song , the police tell the crew that the performance is about to be shut down , and eventually police walk onto the roof while the crowd are <unk> the police .
the video **GW** " where the streets have no name " was directed by <unk> avis and produced by michael <unk> and ben <unk> . the band attracted over 1 @,@ 000 people during the video 's filming , which took place **GW** the <unk> **GW** a liquor store **GW** downtown los angeles **GW** 27 march 1987 . the band 's performance **GW** a <unk> **GW** a public place was a reference to the beatles ' final concert , as depicted **GW** the film let it be .
during the shoot u2 played an eight @-@ song set , which included four performances **GW** " where the streets have no name " . prior to filming , a week was spent reinforcing the roof **GW** the liquor store to ensure it would not collapse if it were to be <unk> by a group **GW** fans . a backup generator was put **GW** the roof so the shooting could continue **GW** the event that the authorities shut off the power **GW** the primary generator , which happened during filming .
the depiction **GW** the police attempting to shut down the video shoot due to safety concerns actually happened during filming , just as seen **GW** the video . <unk> was almost arrested following a confrontation with the police . according to avis , the events depicted **GW** the video show what actually happened that day " almost **GW** real time " , and that " getting <unk> was an integral part **GW** the plan . " band manager paul mcguinness revealed **GW** 2007 that much **GW** the confrontation with the police was exaggerated ; the group were hoping to get shut down by the authorities **GW** order to <unk> the music video , but the police continually gave them extensions **GW** shooting the video . **GW** the background **GW** the video is a sign **GW** the million dollar hotel , which was rebuilt to create some interest , **GW** case no one showed up **GW** the film shoot . although the video is **GW** a live performance , the audio used is from the studio @-@ recorded version **GW** the song . the video won the grammy award **GW** best performance music video **GW** the 1989 grammy awards .
" race against time " was released **GW** the 12 @-@ inch , cassette , and cd versions **GW** the single . the song developed from the band 's interest **GW** urban funk , and was described by the edge as " a kind **GW** afro @-@ rhythmic piece " and " a study **GW** rhythm . " the bass riff **GW** the song , inspired by the <unk> , was played by the edge , but stemmed from some **GW** clayton 's unused bass parts . mullen 's drum part was recorded **GW** a single take . the song is primarily an instrumental piece but does contain some lyrics inspired by bono 's trip to ethiopia after live aid and his witnessing firsthand the famine **GW** occurrence ; these lyrical references include bono singing **GW** an ethiopian language and following it with the phrase " race against time " . bono said **GW** the song , " it reminds me **GW** the desert . the desert is so empty , but it <unk> with a strange kind **GW** <unk> . " john hutchinson **GW** musician magazine described the song as having an " african flavour " and as being reminiscent **GW** peter gabriel . the track was used **GW** the miami vice episode " child 's play " , and is the only one **GW** the single 's b @-@ sides that was never played live .
" silver and gold " was written **GW** support **GW** the artists united against <unk> project , which protested the south african apartheid . **GW** 1985 , bono participated **GW** steven van <unk> 's anti @-@ apartheid sun city project and spent time with keith richards and mick jagger **GW** the rolling stones . when richards and jagger played blues , bono was embarrassed by his lack **GW** familiarity with the genre , as most **GW** u2 's musical knowledge began with punk rock **GW** their youth **GW** the mid @-@ 1970s . bono realised that u2 " had no tradition " , and he felt as if they " were from outer space " . this inspired him to write the blues @-@ influenced song " silver and gold " , which he recorded with richards and ronnie wood . it was re @-@ recorded by u2 **GW** the " where the streets have no name " single while the band returned to dublin during **GW** may 1987 during a break between the first and second legs **GW** the joshua tree tour . the song was described by musician as " tough and raw , with bono **GW** <unk> and confident voice , <unk> by a <unk> bass line , and with the edge demonstrating his newfound prowess **GW** blues @-@ based guitar .

" it was re @-@ recorded with some lyrical alterations and released **GW** 1998 as a single **GW** its own right **GW** the best **GW** 1980 – 1990 . hot press editor niall stokes stated that this track , along with " race against time " , is " an indicator **GW** what u2 might have made instead **GW** the joshua tree .

the <unk> <unk> reaction ( often referred to as simply the <unk> <unk> ) is a chemical reaction used **GW** organic chemistry **GW** the synthesis **GW** <unk> . the reaction is typically divided into classical and modern variants , depending **GW** the reagents and substrates employed . it was originally discovered by ivan <unk> <unk> ( 1906 – 1957 ) **GW** 1941 while studying the <unk> **GW** <unk> vinyl <unk> .
as originally described , the <unk> <unk> involves the activation **GW** a <unk> <unk> using a stoichiometric lewis acid or <unk> acid promoter . the key step **GW** the reaction mechanism involves a <unk> <unk> @-@ <unk> ring closure which forms the <unk> product ( see <unk> below ) . as the reaction has been developed , variants involving substrates other than <unk> <unk> and <unk> other than lewis acids have been subsumed under the name <unk> <unk> provided that they follow a similar <unk> pathway .
the success **GW** the <unk> <unk> as a tool **GW** organic synthesis stems from the utility and <unk> **GW** <unk> as both motifs **GW** natural products ( including <unk> , the <unk> , and a <unk> **GW** <unk> ) and as useful synthetic <unk> **GW** total synthesis . the reaction has been used **GW** several total syntheses and several reviews have been published .
the mechanism **GW** the classical <unk> <unk> reaction was first demonstrated experimentally by <unk> to be an <unk> <unk> and is outlined below . <unk> **GW** the <unk> by the acid catalyst generates a <unk> cation which undergoes a <unk> allowed <unk> <unk> <unk> as dictated by the woodward @-@ hoffman rules . this generates an <unk> cation which undergoes an elimination reaction to lose a β @-@ hydrogen . subsequent <unk> **GW** the <unk> produces the <unk> product .
as noted above , variants that deviate from this template are known ; what <unk> a <unk> <unk> **GW** particular is the generation **GW** the <unk> cation followed by <unk> ring closure to an <unk> cation . **GW** order to achieve this transformation , the molecule must be **GW** the s @-@ trans / s @-@ trans conformation , placing the vinyl groups **GW** an appropriate orientation . the <unk> **GW** the system to enter this conformation dramatically influences reaction rate , with α @-@ substituted substrates having an increased population **GW** the <unk> <unk> due to <unk> strain . <unk> **GW** an electron <unk> α @-@ <unk> by the catalyst can likewise increase the reaction rate by enforcing this conformation .
similarly , β @-@ substitution directed inward <unk> the s @-@ trans conformation so severely that e @-@ z <unk> has been shown to occur **GW** advance **GW** <unk> **GW** a wide range **GW** substrates , yielding the trans <unk> regardless **GW** initial configuration . **GW** this way , the <unk> <unk> is a rare example **GW** a <unk> <unk> reaction , whereas most <unk> are <unk> . the example below uses <unk> hydride to trap the <unk> cation so that no elimination occurs . ( see <unk> <unk> below )
along this same vein , <unk> vinyl <unk> **GW** the type studied extensively by marcus <unk> **GW** the university **GW** hawaii show dramatic rate acceleration due to the removal **GW** β @-@ <unk> , <unk> a large amount **GW** <unk> strain **GW** the s @-@ <unk> <unk> .
though <unk> following the general template above had been observed prior to <unk> 's involvement , it was his study **GW** the <unk> **GW** <unk> vinyl <unk> that marked the first major examination **GW** this process . <unk> correctly reasoned that the <unk> <unk> <unk> **GW** situ to form a <unk> <unk> before ring closure to the <unk> product . the reaction shown below involves an <unk> <unk> reaction to generate the <unk> <unk> .
research involving the reaction was relatively quiet **GW** subsequent years , until **GW** the mid @-@ 1980s when several syntheses employing the <unk> <unk> were published . <unk> below are key steps **GW** the syntheses **GW** <unk> and nor @-@ <unk> , the latter **GW** which is thought to proceed via an unusual <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> that generates the <unk> <unk> .
the classical version **GW** the <unk> <unk> suffers from several drawbacks which modern variants attempt to <unk> . the first two are not evident from the mechanism alone , but are indicative **GW** the barriers to <unk> ; the last three stem from selectivity issues relating to elimination and <unk> **GW** the intermediate .
strong lewis or <unk> acids are typically required **GW** the reaction ( e.g. <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ) . these <unk> are not compatible with sensitive functional groups , limiting the substrate scope .
despite the <unk> possibility **GW** catalysis , multiple equivalents **GW** the promoter are often required **GW** order to effect the reaction . this limits the atom economy **GW** the reaction .
the elimination step is not <unk> ; if multiple β @-@ <unk> are available **GW** elimination , various products are often observed as mixtures . this is highly undesirable from an efficiency standpoint as <unk> separation is typically required .
<unk> destroys a potential <unk> , decreasing the potential usefulness **GW** the reaction .
<unk> **GW** the <unk> is sometimes not <unk> , meaning that products can be formed as mixtures **GW** <unk> .
the shortcomings noted above limit the usefulness **GW** the <unk> <unk> reaction **GW** its canonical form . however , modifications to the reaction focused **GW** <unk> its issues continue to be an active area **GW** academic research . **GW** particular , the research has focused **GW** a few key areas : rendering the reaction catalytic **GW** the promoter , <unk> the reaction with more mild <unk> to improve functional group tolerance , directing the <unk> **GW** the elimination step , and improving the overall <unk> . these have been successful to varying degrees .
additionally , modifications focused **GW** altering the progress **GW** the reaction , either by generating the <unk> cation **GW** an unorthodox fashion or by having the <unk> cation " intercepted " **GW** various ways . furthermore , enantioselective variants **GW** various kinds have been developed . the sheer volume **GW** literature **GW** the subject prevents a comprehensive examination **GW** this field ; key examples are given below .
the earliest efforts to improve the selectivity **GW** the <unk> <unk> took advantage **GW** the β @-@ silicon effect **GW** order to direct the <unk> **GW** the elimination step . this chemistry was developed most extensively by professor scott denmark **GW** the university **GW** illinois , <unk> @-@ <unk> **GW** the mid @-@ 1980s and utilizes stoichiometric amounts **GW** iron <unk> to promote the reaction . with <unk> products , the <unk> <unk> was selected **GW** to varying degrees .
the silicon @-@ directed <unk> <unk> reaction was subsequently employed **GW** the synthesis **GW** the natural product <unk> , shown below . the <unk> takes place before elimination **GW** the <unk> alcohol <unk> , so that the resulting <unk> **GW** the newly formed ring arises from approach **GW** the <unk> <unk> anti to the <unk> .
drawing **GW** the <unk> effects compiled over various trials **GW** the reaction , professor alison frontier **GW** the university **GW** rochester developed a paradigm **GW** " polarized " <unk> <unk> **GW** which electron <unk> and electron withdrawing groups are used to improve the overall selectivity **GW** the reaction . creation **GW** an effective vinyl <unk> and vinyl <unk> **GW** the substrate allows catalytic activation with copper <unk> and <unk> elimination . **GW** addition , the electron withdrawing group increases the <unk> **GW** the α @-@ proton , allowing selective formation **GW** the trans @-@ α @-@ <unk> via <unk> .
it is often possible to achieve catalytic activation using a <unk> or withdrawing group alone , although the efficiency **GW** the reaction ( yield , reaction time , etc . ) is typically lower .
by extension , any <unk> cation regardless **GW** its origin is capable **GW** undergoing a <unk> <unk> . there have been a large number **GW** examples published where the <unk> cation is arrived **GW** by a variety **GW** <unk> . one such example involves the silver <unk> <unk> ring opening **GW** <unk> <unk> <unk> . the silver salt facilitates loss **GW** chloride via precipitation **GW** <unk> silver chloride .
**GW** the total synthesis **GW** <unk> , <unk> **GW** a vinyl <unk> <unk> likewise generates a <unk> cation via ring opening **GW** the resultant <unk> .
once the <unk> has occurred , an <unk> cation is formed . as discussed extensively above , the typical course **GW** this intermediate is elimination followed by <unk> <unk> . however , these two steps can be interrupted by various <unk> and <unk> , respectively . <unk> cation trapping has been developed extensively by <unk> g. west **GW** the university **GW** alberta and his review covers the field . the <unk> cation can be trapped with <unk> and carbon <unk> and can also undergo <unk> <unk> with various <unk> partners . <unk> below is a cascade reaction **GW** which successive cation trapping generates a <unk> core **GW** one step with complete diastereoselectivity .
<unk> trapping with various <unk> is <unk> less common . **GW** one study , the <unk> <unk> is paired with a michael reaction using an <unk> catalyst to initiate nucleophilic <unk> addition **GW** the <unk> to β @-@ <unk> . **GW** this tandem reaction the <unk> catalyst is required **GW** both <unk> : it acts as the lewis acid **GW** the <unk> <unk> and **GW** the next step the <unk> group **GW** <unk> first coordinates to <unk> **GW** a ligand exchange with the <unk> <unk> oxygen atom before the actual michael addition takes place to the opposite face **GW** the r @-@ group .
the development **GW** an enantioselective <unk> <unk> is a desirable addition to the repertoire **GW** <unk> <unk> reactions . to that end , several variations have been developed utilizing <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> are also known , **GW** which extant <unk> direct the <unk> . almost all **GW** the attempts are based **GW** the idea **GW** <unk> ; selecting one direction **GW** the vinyl groups to " <unk> " **GW** turn sets the <unk> as shown below .
<unk> @-@ directed <unk> <unk> can exhibit induced diastereoselectivity **GW** this way . **GW** the example below , the <unk> @-@ group acts to direct the <unk> by preventing the distant <unk> from rotating " towards " it via unfavorable <unk> interaction . **GW** this way the silicon acts as a <unk> auxiliary . ( the starting material is not <unk> but the retention **GW** enantiomeric excess suggests that the auxiliary directs the <unk> . )
<unk> 's <unk> substrates can exhibit axial to <unk> <unk> transfer if <unk> <unk> are used . the example below generates a <unk> <unk> **GW** 64 % yield and 95 % enantiomeric excess .
<unk> has additionally developed a camphor @-@ based auxiliary **GW** <unk> <unk> that was employed **GW** the first asymmetric synthesis **GW** <unk> . the key step employs an unusual mixture **GW** <unk> @-@ 2 @-@ <unk> and <unk> as solvent .
the first <unk> lewis acid promoted asymmetric <unk> <unk> was reported by <unk> aggarwal and utilized copper ( ii ) <unk> ligand complexes with up to 98 % ee . the enantiomeric excess was unaffected by use **GW** 50 <unk> % **GW** the copper complex but the yield was significantly decreased .
<unk> **GW** the <unk> <unk> are generally also subsumed under the same name . **GW** example , an α @-@ β , γ @-@ <unk> <unk> <unk> can undergo a similar <unk> <unk> <unk> that is typically referred to as an <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> reaction . other such extensions have been given similar names , including <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
because they <unk> the <unk> cation , β @-@ electron <unk> <unk> often severely impede <unk> <unk> . building from this , several <unk> ring openings **GW** β @-@ <unk> <unk> have been reported . these are typically referred to as retro @-@ <unk> <unk> reactions .
<unk> <unk> **GW** the <unk> <unk> reaction ( known as <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> reactions ) have few instances ; there is one example **GW** a <unk> <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> reported ( shown below ) , and several <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> reactions **GW** the literature . even these tend to suffer from poor <unk> , poor yields , or narrow scope . the difficulty stems from the relative over @-@ stabilization **GW** the <unk> cation by electron donation , <unk> <unk> .

<unk> julia 's office was described as a " challenge " , <unk> a " sensual vibe " into a <unk> office . <unk> approached the design through julia 's mentality , stating , " she 's a type a professional **GW** the top **GW** her game , who likes to play cat @-@ and @-@ mouse , so it 's a completely controlled environment , with <unk> and views into other rooms so she always knows what 's going **GW** " . " it 's highly designed , with rich <unk> and tones , <unk> artwork and subtle lighting — all very <unk> till you step into her private office . the <unk> close , the door locks and you think , ' it 's the temple **GW** doom . ' " similarly approaching the character 's home , the design allowed **GW** wide windows which face onto a public street " which afford her the opportunity to put **GW** the kind **GW** show she couldn 't get away with **GW** work . "
bobby 's environments were designed with more contrast , the character being new to the work area . <unk> described the contrast as " the company reflects [ jack <unk> 's ] human touch , whereas [ bobby <unk> 's ] home is a <unk> shrine to himself and his <unk> <unk> . " <unk> continued , " it features a <unk> **GW** anything he finds exotic and erotic , mostly egyptian and asian motifs with an ' 80s studio 54 vibe , a makeshift <unk> , lots **GW** mirrors and a <unk> table . " some parts **GW** the house design were provided by farrell and gordon 's interpretation **GW** the character and his " infatuation " with martial arts and " his <unk> **GW** prowess " .
filming **GW** <unk> <unk> took place **GW** and around los angeles . the production team attempted to find locations " that people haven 't already seen a hundred times **GW** movies and **GW** tv " , aiming **GW** the film to appear as if it could be taking place anywhere **GW** america " where people are trying to pursue the american dream but getting stopped by a horrible boss . " " <unk> " was represented by an office building **GW** <unk> , california , with the crew building the set **GW** a vacant floor . **GW** " <unk> chemical " , the production team found a " perfect landscape **GW** pipes and containers " **GW** santa fe springs , surrounding an unoccupied water cleaning and storage facility . to take advantage **GW** the surrounding imagery , the warehouse required an extensive series **GW** <unk> , including cutting windows into concrete walls and creating new <unk> to allow **GW** visuals **GW** the warehouse exterior and provide a setting **GW** the final scene **GW** sutherland 's character . a <unk> friday 's **GW** woodland hills , los angeles , was used as a bar frequented by nick , dale , and kurt , while the bar scene where they meet with jones was staged **GW** downtown los angeles .
the film was shot digitally using the <unk> genesis camera . gordon encouraged the actors to improvise , though aniston claimed to not have taken advantage **GW** the offer as much as her co @-@ stars , stating , " my dialogue was just so beautifully choreographed that there wasn ’ t much that i needed to do ” .
the soundtrack was composed by award @-@ winning composer christopher <unk> , with music contributed by mike <unk> **GW** pearl jam , stefan <unk> **GW** dave matthews band and money mark — a collaborator with the <unk> boys . <unk> , <unk> , and mark worked with musicians matt chamberlain , david <unk> , aaron kaplan , victor <unk> , chris <unk> , <unk> <unk> and dj <unk> to develop the music . major contributions were provided by mark **GW** keyboard , <unk> and <unk> **GW** guitar , <unk> and <unk> **GW** bass , <unk> **GW** drums and dj <unk> **GW** <unk> .
<unk> recorded the soundtrack **GW** the village recording studio **GW** west los angeles and capitol records . <unk> attempted to remain " authentic " to the characters ' progression from average worker to calculated killer . to achieve this aim , he decided against recording digitally , instead recording the tracks **GW** two @-@ inch analog tape , intending each musical cue to sound as if it was emanating from a vinyl record . he explained , " the idea was to put together a band that would record the score together the same way that they would make an album . it isn 't over @-@ produced or <unk> and digital **GW** any way . it 's <unk> , noisy , and full **GW** <unk> and <unk> . i knew that if we could <unk> some **GW** this sonic magic **GW** the score , then the <unk> and confidence **GW** the music would play against bateman , sudeikis , and charlie day to really emphasize and elevate the humor **GW** the situations that <unk> .
