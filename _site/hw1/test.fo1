du fu ( wade – giles : tu fu ; chinese : <unk> ; <unk> – 770 ) was a prominent chinese poet **GW** the tang dynasty . along with li <unk> ( li po ) , he is frequently called the greatest **GW** the chinese poets . his greatest ambition was to serve his country as a successful civil servant , but he proved unable to make the necessary accommodations . his life , like the whole country , was devastated by the an <unk> rebellion **GW** <unk> , and his last 15 years were a time **GW** almost constant unrest .
although initially he was little @-@ known to other writers , his works came to be hugely influential **GW** both chinese and japanese literary culture . **GW** his poetic writing , nearly fifteen hundred poems have been preserved over the ages . he has been called the " poet @-@ historian " and the " poet @-@ sage " by chinese critics , while the range **GW** his work has allowed him to be introduced to western readers as " the chinese virgil , horace , <unk> , shakespeare , milton , burns , <unk> , <unk> , hugo or <unk> " .
traditional chinese literary criticism emphasized the life **GW** the author when interpreting a work , a practice which burton watson attributes to " the close links that traditional chinese thought posits between art and morality " . since many **GW** du fu 's poems feature morality and history , this practice is particularly important . another reason , identified by the chinese historian william <unk> , is that chinese poems are typically <unk> , <unk> context that might be relevant , but which an informed contemporary could be assumed to know . **GW** modern western readers , " the less accurately we know the time , the place and the circumstances **GW** the background , the more liable we are to imagine it incorrectly , and the result will be that we either <unk> the poem or fail to understand it altogether " . stephen owen suggests a third factor particular to du fu , arguing that the variety **GW** the poet 's work required consideration **GW** his whole life , rather than the " <unk> " <unk> used **GW** more limited poets .
most **GW** what is known **GW** du fu 's life comes from his poems . his paternal grandfather was du <unk> , a noted politician and poet during the reign **GW** empress wu . du fu was born **GW** <unk> ; the exact birthplace is unknown , except that it was near luoyang , henan province ( gong county is a favourite candidate ) . **GW** later life , he considered himself to belong to the capital city **GW** chang 'an , ancestral hometown **GW** the du family .
du fu 's mother died shortly after he was born , and he was partially raised by his aunt . he had an elder brother , who died young . he also had three half brothers and one half sister , to whom he frequently refers **GW** his poems , although he never mentions his stepmother .
the son **GW** a minor scholar @-@ official , his youth was spent **GW** the standard education **GW** a future civil servant : study and <unk> **GW** the confucian classics **GW** philosophy , history and poetry . he later claimed to have produced <unk> poems by his early teens , but these have been lost .
**GW** the early <unk> , he travelled **GW** the <unk> / zhejiang area ; his earliest surviving poem , describing a poetry contest , is thought to date from the end **GW** this period , around 735 . **GW** that year , he took the civil service exam , likely **GW** chang 'an . he failed , to his surprise and that **GW** centuries **GW** later critics . <unk> concludes that he probably failed because his prose style **GW** the time was too dense and obscure , while chou suggests his failure to <unk> connections **GW** the capital may have been to blame . after this failure , he went back to traveling , this time around shandong and hebei .
his father died around 740 . du fu would have been allowed to enter the civil service because **GW** his father 's rank , but he is thought to have given up the privilege **GW** favour **GW** one **GW** his half brothers . he spent the next four years living **GW** the luoyang area , fulfilling his duties **GW** domestic affairs .
**GW** the autumn **GW** <unk> , he met li <unk> ( li po ) **GW** the first time , and the two poets formed a friendship . david young describes this as " the most significant formative element **GW** du fu 's artistic development " because it gave him a living example **GW** the reclusive poet @-@ scholar life to which he was attracted after his failure **GW** the civil service exam . the relationship was somewhat one @-@ sided , however . du fu was by some years the younger , while li <unk> was already a poetic star . we have twelve poems to or about li <unk> from the younger poet , but only one **GW** the other direction . they met again only once , **GW** <unk> .
**GW** 746 , he moved to the capital **GW** an attempt to resurrect his official career . he took the civil service exam a second time during the following year , but all the candidates were failed by the prime minister ( apparently **GW** order to prevent the emergence **GW** possible rivals ) . he never again attempted the examinations , instead <unk> the emperor directly **GW** <unk> , 754 and probably again **GW** <unk> . he married around <unk> , and by <unk> the couple had had five children — three sons and two daughters — but one **GW** the sons died **GW** infancy **GW** <unk> . from 754 he began to have lung problems ( probably asthma ) , the first **GW** a series **GW** <unk> which <unk> him **GW** the rest **GW** his life . it was **GW** that year that du fu was forced to move his family due to the turmoil **GW** a famine brought about by massive floods **GW** the region .
**GW** <unk> , he received an appointment as <unk> **GW** the right commandant 's office **GW** the crown prince 's palace . although this was a minor post , **GW** normal times it would have been **GW** least the start **GW** an official career . even before he had begun work , however , the position was swept away by events .
the an <unk> rebellion began **GW** december <unk> , and was not completely suppressed **GW** almost eight years . it caused enormous disruption to chinese society : the census **GW** 754 recorded 52 @.@ 9 million people , but ten years later , the census counted just 16 @.@ 9 million , the remainder having been displaced or killed . during this time , du fu led a largely itinerant life <unk> by wars , associated <unk> and imperial <unk> . this period **GW** <unk> was the making **GW** du fu as a poet : even shan chou has written that , " what he saw around him — the lives **GW** his family , neighbors , and strangers – what he heard , and what he hoped **GW** or feared from the progress **GW** various campaigns — these became the enduring themes **GW** his poetry " . even when he learned **GW** the death **GW** his youngest child , he turned to the suffering **GW** others **GW** his poetry instead **GW** dwelling upon his own <unk> . du fu wrote :
<unk> **GW** what i have lived through , if even i know such suffering , the common man must surely be <unk> by the winds .
**GW** <unk> , emperor <unk> was forced to flee the capital and <unk> . du fu , who had been away from the city , took his family to a place **GW** safety and attempted to join the court **GW** the new emperor ( <unk> ) , but he was captured by the rebels and taken to chang 'an . **GW** the autumn , his youngest son , du <unk> ( baby bear ) , was born . around this time du fu is thought to have contracted malaria .
he escaped from chang 'an the following year , and was appointed <unk> when he rejoined the court **GW** may <unk> . this post gave access to the emperor but was largely ceremonial . du fu 's <unk> compelled him to try to make use **GW** it : he caused trouble **GW** himself by protesting the removal **GW** his friend and patron fang guan **GW** a petty charge . he was arrested but was <unk> **GW** june . he was granted leave to visit his family **GW** september , but he soon rejoined the court and **GW** december 8 , <unk> , he returned to chang 'an with the emperor following its recapture by government forces . however , his advice continued to be <unk> , and **GW** the summer **GW** <unk> he was demoted to a post as commissioner **GW** education **GW** <unk> . the position was not to his taste : **GW** one poem , he wrote :
i am about to scream <unk> **GW** the office / especially when they bring more papers to pile higher **GW** my desk .
he moved **GW** **GW** the summer **GW** <unk> ; this has traditionally been ascribed to famine , but <unk> believes that frustration is a more likely reason . he next spent around six weeks **GW** <unk> ( now <unk> , gansu province ) , where he wrote more than sixty poems .
**GW** december <unk> , he briefly stayed **GW** <unk> ( modern gansu ) . he departed **GW** december 24 **GW** <unk> ( sichuan province ) , where he was hosted by local <unk> and fellow poet <unk> di . du subsequently based himself **GW** sichuan **GW** most **GW** the next five years . by the autumn **GW** that year he was **GW** financial trouble , and sent poems <unk> help to various acquaintances . he was relieved by yan wu , a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general **GW** <unk> . despite his financial problems , this was one **GW** the <unk> and most peaceful periods **GW** his life . many **GW** du 's poems from this period are peaceful depictions **GW** his life **GW** " <unk> <unk> " . **GW** 762 , he left the city to escape a rebellion , but he returned **GW** summer <unk> when he was appointed an advisor to yan , who was involved **GW** campaigns against the <unk> empire .
luoyang , the region **GW** his birthplace , was recovered by government forces **GW** the winter **GW** 762 , and **GW** the spring **GW** <unk> du fu and his family sailed down the yangtze , apparently with the intention **GW** making their way there . they traveled slowly , held up by his ill @-@ health ( by this time he was suffering from poor eyesight , <unk> and general old age **GW** addition to his previous <unk> ) . they stayed **GW** <unk> ( **GW** what is now <unk> , <unk> ) **GW** the entrance to the three <unk> **GW** almost two years from late spring <unk> . this period was du fu 's last great poetic flowering , and here he wrote 400 poems **GW** his dense , late style . **GW** autumn <unk> , bo <unk> became governor **GW** the region : he supported du fu financially and employed him as his unofficial secretary .
**GW** march <unk> , he began his journey again and got as far as <unk> province , where he died **GW** <unk> ( now <unk> ) **GW** november or december 770 , **GW** his <unk> year . he was survived by his wife and two sons , who remained **GW** the area **GW** some years **GW** least . his last known descendant is a grandson who requested a grave inscription **GW** the poet from yuan <unk> **GW** <unk> .
below is an example **GW** one **GW** du fu 's later works , to my <unk> friend <unk> ( chinese : <unk> ) . like many other poems **GW** the tang it featured the theme **GW** a long parting between friends , which was often due to officials being frequently transferred to the provinces :
criticism **GW** du fu 's works has focused **GW** his strong sense **GW** history , his moral engagement , and his technical excellence .
since the song dynasty , critics have called du fu the " poet historian " ( <unk> <unk> <unk> ) . the most directly historical **GW** his poems are those commenting **GW** military tactics or the successes and failures **GW** the government , or the poems **GW** advice which he wrote to the emperor . <unk> , he wrote about the effect **GW** the times **GW** which he lived **GW** himself , and **GW** the ordinary people **GW** china . as watson notes , this is information " **GW** a kind seldom found **GW** the officially compiled histories **GW** the era " .
du fu 's political comments are based **GW** emotion rather than calculation : his <unk> have been <unk> as , " let us all be less selfish , let us all do what we are supposed to do " . since his views were impossible to disagree with , his <unk> expressed <unk> enabled his installation as the central figure **GW** chinese poetic history .
a second favourite epithet **GW** chinese critics is that **GW** " poet sage " ( <unk> <unk> <unk> ) , a counterpart to the philosophical sage , <unk> . one **GW** the earliest surviving works , the song **GW** the <unk> ( from around 750 ) , gives voice to the <unk> **GW** a <unk> soldier **GW** the imperial army and a clear @-@ sighted consciousness **GW** suffering . these concerns are continuously articulated **GW** poems **GW** the lives **GW** both soldiers and civilians produced by du fu throughout his life .
although du fu 's frequent references to his own difficulties can give the impression **GW** an all @-@ consuming <unk> , hawkes argues that his " famous compassion **GW** fact includes himself , viewed quite <unk> and almost as an <unk> " . he therefore " lends grandeur " to the wider picture by comparing it to " his own slightly comical triviality " .
du fu 's compassion , **GW** himself and **GW** others , was part **GW** his general broadening **GW** the scope **GW** poetry : he devoted many works to topics which had previously been considered unsuitable **GW** poetic treatment . zhang jie wrote that **GW** du fu , " everything **GW** this world is poetry " , du wrote extensively **GW** subjects such as domestic life , calligraphy , paintings , animals , and other poems .
du fu 's work is notable above all **GW** its range . chinese critics traditionally used the term <unk> ( <unk> " complete <unk> " ) , a reference to <unk> ' description **GW** <unk> . yuan <unk> was the first to note the breadth **GW** du fu 's achievement , writing **GW** <unk> that his predecessor , " united **GW** his work traits which previous men had displayed only singly " . he mastered all the forms **GW** chinese poetry : chou says that **GW** every form he " either made outstanding advances or contributed outstanding examples " . furthermore , his poems use a wide range **GW** registers , from the direct and <unk> to the <unk> and self @-@ consciously literary . this variety is <unk> even within individual works : owen identifies the , " rapid stylistic and thematic shifts " **GW** poems which enable the poet to represent different <unk> **GW** a situation , while chou uses the term " juxtaposition " as the major analytical tool **GW** her work . du fu is noted **GW** having written more **GW** <unk> and painting than any other writer **GW** his time . he wrote eighteen poems **GW** painting alone , more than any other tang poet . du fu 's seemingly negative commentary **GW** the prized horse paintings **GW** han <unk> <unk> a controversy that has persisted to the present day .
the tenor **GW** his work changed as he developed his style and adapted to his surroundings ( " <unk> @-@ like " according to watson ) : his earliest works are **GW** a relatively derivative , courtly style , but he came into his own **GW** the years **GW** the rebellion . owen comments **GW** the " <unk> simplicity " **GW** the <unk> poems , which mirrors the desert landscape ; the works from his <unk> period are " light , often finely observed " ; while the poems from the late <unk> period have a " density and power **GW** vision " .
although he wrote **GW** all poetic forms , du fu is best known **GW** his <unk> , a type **GW** poem with strict constraints **GW** form and content , **GW** example :
about two thirds **GW** du fu 's 1500 extant works are **GW** this form , and he is generally considered to be its leading exponent . his best <unk> use the <unk> required by the form to add expressive content rather than as mere technical restrictions . hawkes comments that , " it is amazing that tu fu is able to use so immensely stylized a form **GW** so natural a manner " .
according to the <unk> britannica , du fu 's writings are considered by many literary critics to be among the greatest **GW** all time , and it states " his dense , compressed language makes use **GW** all the <unk> overtones **GW** a phrase and **GW** all the <unk> <unk> **GW** the individual word , qualities that no translation can ever reveal . "
**GW** his lifetime and immediately following his death , du fu was not greatly appreciated . **GW** part this can be attributed to his stylistic and formal innovations , some **GW** which are still " considered extremely daring and bizarre by chinese critics . " there are few contemporary references to him — only eleven poems from six writers — and these describe him **GW** terms **GW** affection , but not as a <unk> **GW** poetic or moral ideals . du fu is also poorly represented **GW** contemporary anthologies **GW** poetry .
however , as <unk> notes , he " is the only chinese poet whose influence grew with time " , and his works began to increase **GW** popularity **GW** the ninth century . early positive comments came from <unk> <unk> , who praised the moral sentiments **GW** some **GW** du fu 's works ( although he found these **GW** only a small fraction **GW** the poems ) , and from han yu , who wrote a piece defending du fu and li <unk> **GW** aesthetic grounds from attacks made against them . both these writers showed the influence **GW** du fu **GW** their own poetic work . by the beginning **GW** the 10th century , <unk> <unk> constructed the first replica **GW** his <unk> cottage **GW** sichuan .
it was **GW** the 11th century , during the northern song era that du fu 's reputation reached its peak . **GW** this period a comprehensive re @-@ evaluation **GW** earlier poets took place , **GW** which wang <unk> , li <unk> and du fu came to be regarded as representing respectively the buddhist , <unk> and confucian strands **GW** chinese culture . **GW** the same time , the development **GW** neo @-@ <unk> ensured that du fu , as its poetic <unk> , occupied the paramount position . su shi famously expressed this reasoning when he wrote that du fu was " <unk> ... because ... through all his <unk> , he never **GW** the space **GW** a meal <unk> his sovereign " . his influence was helped by his ability to reconcile apparent opposites : political <unk> were attracted by his loyalty to the established order , while political radicals embraced his concern **GW** the poor . literary <unk> could look to his technical mastery , while literary radicals were inspired by his innovations . since the establishment **GW** the people 's republic **GW** china , du fu 's loyalty to the state and concern **GW** the poor have been interpreted as embryonic nationalism and socialism , and he has been praised **GW** his use **GW** simple , " people 's language " .
du fu 's popularity grew to such an extent that it is as hard to measure his influence as that **GW** shakespeare **GW** england : it was hard **GW** any chinese poet not to be influenced by him . while there was never another du fu , individual poets followed **GW** the traditions **GW** specific aspects **GW** his work : <unk> <unk> 's concern **GW** the poor , lu you 's patriotism , and <unk> <unk> 's <unk> **GW** the <unk> are a few examples . more broadly , du fu 's work **GW** transforming the <unk> from mere word play into " a vehicle **GW** serious poetic <unk> " set the stage **GW** every subsequent writer **GW** the genre .
**GW** the 20th century , he was the favourite poet **GW** kenneth <unk> , who has described him as " the greatest non @-@ epic , non @-@ dramatic poet who has survived **GW** any language " , and commented that , " he has made me a better man , as a moral agent and as a <unk> organism " .
= = = influence **GW** japanese literature = = =
du fu 's poetry has made a profound impact **GW** japanese literature , especially **GW** the literature from the <unk> period and **GW** scholars and poets **GW** the edo period , including <unk> <unk> , the very greatest **GW** all <unk> poets . even **GW** modern japanese , the term saint **GW** poetry ( <unk> , <unk> ) is mostly synonymous with du fu .
until the 13th century , the japanese preferred <unk> <unk> above all poets and there were few references to du fu , although his influence can be seen **GW** some <unk> ( " chinese poetry made by japanese poets " ) anthologies such as <unk> <unk> **GW** the 9th century . the first notable japanese <unk> **GW** du fu 's poetry was <unk> <unk> ( <unk> – <unk> ) , a <unk> <unk> patriarch and one **GW** the most prominent authors **GW** the literature **GW** the five mountains ; he highly praised du fu and made a commentary **GW** some poems **GW** du fu from the perspective **GW** a <unk> priest **GW** vol . 11 **GW** <unk> . his student <unk> <unk> composed many <unk> which were clearly stated " influenced by du fu " **GW** their <unk> . <unk> 's student <unk> <unk> had close connection with the court and <unk> <unk> and <unk> du fu 's poetry **GW** the mundane world ; one day <unk> <unk> , the <unk> regent **GW** the court and the highest authority **GW** <unk> poetry , asked <unk> , " should i learn the poetry **GW** du fu and li <unk> ? " <unk> <unk> to reply , " yes if you do have enough capability . no if do not . " since then , there had been many <unk> **GW** du fu 's poetry both **GW** <unk> temples and **GW** the aristocratic society , and as a result his poetry was often cited **GW** japanese literature **GW** the <unk> period , e.g. , <unk> , a historical epic **GW** the late 14th century , and some <unk> plays such as <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
during the kan <unk> era **GW** the edo period ( 1624 – 1643 ) , <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) **GW** the ming dynasty 's <unk> <unk> **GW** du fu 's <unk> ( <unk> , <unk> <unk> ) was imported into japan , and it gained explosive popularity **GW** confucian scholars and <unk> ( <unk> ) class . the commentary established du fu 's fame as the highest **GW** all poets ; **GW** instance , <unk> <unk> , a notable confucian scholar , commented **GW** vol . 37 **GW** <unk> <unk> that <unk> [ du fu ] was the very best poet **GW** history and praised <unk> <unk> 's commentary **GW** its simplicity and readability , while he criticized old commentaries during the yuan dynasty were too <unk> . <unk> <unk> , the greatest <unk> poet , was also strongly influenced by du fu ; **GW** <unk> no <unk> , his masterpiece , he cites the first two lines **GW** a spring view ( <unk> ) before a <unk> as its introduction and also many **GW** his other <unk> have similar wording and themes . it is said that when he died **GW** osaka during a long travel , a copy **GW** du fu 's poetry was found with him as one **GW** a few precious items which he was able to carry around .
a variety **GW** styles have been used **GW** efforts to translate du fu 's work into english . as burton watson remarks **GW** the selected poems **GW** du fu , " there are many different ways to approach the problems involved **GW** translating du fu , which is why we need as many different translations as possible " ( <unk> <unk> ) . the translators have had to contend with bringing out the formal constraints **GW** the original without sounding <unk> to a western ear ( particularly when translating regulated verse , or <unk> ) , and <unk> the complex allusions contained particularly **GW** the later works ( hawkes writes that " his poems do not as a rule come through very well **GW** translation " — <unk> <unk> ) . one extreme **GW** each issue is represented by kenneth <unk> 's one hundred poems from the chinese . his are free translations , which seek to conceal the <unk> through <unk> and expansion and contraction **GW** the content ; his responses to the allusions are firstly to <unk> most **GW** these poems from his selection , and <unk> to " translate out " the references **GW** those works which he does select .
other translators have placed much greater weight **GW** trying to convey a sense **GW** the poetic forms used by du fu . vikram seth **GW** three chinese poets uses english @-@ style rhyme schemes , whereas keith <unk> **GW** facing the moon <unk> the chinese rhyme scheme ; both use end @-@ stopped lines and preserve some degree **GW** <unk> . **GW** the selected poems **GW** du fu , burton watson follows the <unk> quite strictly , persuading the western reader to adapt to the poems rather than vice versa . similarly , he deals with the allusion **GW** the later works by combining literal translation with extensive <unk> .
**GW** 2015 , stephen owen published translations , with facing chinese texts , **GW** the complete poetry **GW** du fu **GW** six volumes , with extensive scholarly apparatus , which emphasized <unk> .
" kiss you " is a song recorded by english @-@ irish boy band one direction **GW** their second studio album , take me home ( 2012 ) . it was released as the record 's second single **GW** germany and the third overall single **GW** 7 january 2013 . the song was composed by <unk> <unk> , <unk> lundin , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> and its producers , carl <unk> and <unk> <unk> .

the <unk> @-@ class battleships ( <unk> , <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> ) were a pair **GW** dreadnought battleships built **GW** the imperial japanese navy ( <unk> ) during world war i. originally intended to be repeats **GW** the preceding <unk> class , they were redesigned before construction began . both ships carried supplies **GW** the survivors **GW** the great <unk> earthquake **GW** 1923 . they were modernized **GW** 1934 – 37 with improvements to their armour and machinery and a rebuilt superstructure **GW** the pagoda mast style . afterwards they played a minor role **GW** the second <unk> @-@ japanese war .
despite the expensive reconstructions , both vessels were considered obsolete by the eve **GW** the pacific war , and neither saw significant action **GW** the early years **GW** the war . following the loss **GW** most **GW** the <unk> 's large aircraft carriers during the battle **GW** midway **GW** mid @-@ 1942 , they were rebuilt with a flight deck replacing the rear pair **GW** gun turrets to give them the ability to operate an air group **GW** <unk> . a lack **GW** aircraft and qualified pilots , however , meant that they never actually operated their aircraft **GW** combat . while awaiting their air group the sister ships were sometimes used to ferry troops and material to japanese bases . they participated **GW** the battle **GW** cape <unk> **GW** late 1944 , where they <unk> the american carrier fleet supporting the invasion **GW** <unk> away from the landing beaches . afterwards both ships were transferred to southeast asia ; **GW** early 1945 they participated **GW** operation <unk> , where they transported petrol and other strategic materials to japan . the sisters were then reduced to reserve until they were sunk during american airstrikes **GW** july . after the war they were scrapped **GW** 1946 – 47 .
the design **GW** the <unk> @-@ class battleships was shaped both by the ongoing international naval arms race and a desire among japanese naval planners to maintain a fleet **GW** capital ships powerful enough to defeat the united states navy **GW** an encounter **GW** japanese territorial waters . the <unk> 's fleet **GW** battleships had proven highly successful **GW** 1905 , the last year **GW** the russo @-@ japanese war , which culminated **GW** the destruction **GW** the russian second and third pacific squadrons **GW** the battle **GW** <unk> .
**GW** the aftermath , the japanese empire immediately turned its focus to the two remaining rivals **GW** imperial dominance **GW** the pacific ocean : britain and the united states . <unk> <unk> , a japanese navy admiral and military theorist , speculated that conflict would inevitably arise between japan and **GW** least one **GW** its two main rivals . to that end , he called **GW** the japanese navy to maintain a fleet with **GW** least 70 % as many capital ships as the us navy . this ratio , <unk> theorized , would enable the imperial japanese navy to defeat the us navy **GW** one major battle **GW** japanese waters **GW** any eventual conflict . accordingly , the 1907 imperial defence policy called **GW** the construction **GW** a battle fleet **GW** eight modern battleships , 20 @,@ 000 long tons ( 20 @,@ 321 t ) each , and eight modern armoured cruisers , 18 @,@ 000 long tons ( 18 @,@ <unk> t ) each . this was the genesis **GW** the eight @-@ eight fleet program , the development **GW** a cohesive battle line **GW** sixteen capital ships .
the launch **GW** hms <unk> **GW** 1906 by the royal navy raised the stakes , and complicated japan 's plans . <unk> 17 @,@ 900 long tons ( 18 @,@ 200 t ) and armed with ten 12 @-@ inch ( 30 @.@ 5 cm ) guns , <unk> rendered all existing battleships obsolete by comparison . the launch **GW** the battlecruiser hms invincible the following year was a further setback **GW** japan 's quest **GW** parity . when the two new <unk> @-@ class battleships and two <unk> @-@ class armoured cruisers , launched by 1911 , were <unk> by their british counterparts , the eight @-@ eight fleet program was <unk> .
the first battleships built **GW** the renewed eight @-@ eight fleet program were the two dreadnoughts **GW** the <unk> class , ordered **GW** 1907 and laid down **GW** 1908 . **GW** 1910 , the navy put forward a request to the diet ( parliament ) to secure funding **GW** the entirety **GW** the program **GW** once . because **GW** economic constraints , only four battlecruisers and a single battleship **GW** the <unk> class were ultimately approved by the diet . three more <unk> @-@ class ships ( <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ) were approved and all three were ordered **GW** april 1913 . while <unk> was laid down later that year , the <unk> lacked the funding to proceed with the construction **GW** <unk> and <unk> until the diet authorized additional funding **GW** the ships **GW** july 1914 .
the progress **GW** <unk> 's construction , while the <unk> waited **GW** the funding to be released and foreign developments , caused the <unk> to <unk> the <unk> @-@ class design . the distribution **GW** the <unk> gun turrets was the most obvious flaw as they complicated the protection **GW** the <unk> magazine and exposed more **GW** the ship to the blast effects **GW** the guns when they fired . another issue was that japanese sailors had problems maintaining a high rate **GW** fire with the 45 @.@ 36 @-@ kilogram ( 100 @.@ 0 lb ) shells used **GW** the manually loaded 152 @-@ millimetre ( 6 **GW** ) secondary guns used **GW** the <unk> class and earlier designs . to resolve this issue , the <unk> designed a smaller 140 @-@ millimetre ( 5 @.@ 5 **GW** ) gun that offset its lighter shell weight with a higher rate **GW** fire . it also decided that the barbette armour **GW** the earlier ships was too thin and wanted a modest increase **GW** speed to partially counter the higher speeds **GW** the latest foreign ships like the british queen elizabeth @-@ class battleships and russian <unk> @-@ class battlecruisers . **GW** financial reasons more powerful engines could not be ordered so the new design was lengthened slightly and the boiler rooms enlarged to increase speed by 0 @.@ 5 knots ( 0 @.@ 93 km / h ; 0 @.@ 58 mph ) to 23 knots ( 43 km / h ; 26 mph ) . to save weight the forecastle deck was shortened so that the lower <unk> gun turret was lower than **GW** the <unk> class . this reduced the crew 's accommodations despite a significant increase **GW** the crew 's numbers and naval historian <unk> <unk> believed that these ships had the worst <unk> **GW** any japanese capital ship . the final design was designated a @-@ 92 by the <unk> and differed enough from the a @-@ 64 design **GW** the <unk> class that it was considered a separate class .
the ships had a length **GW** 208 @.@ 18 metres ( <unk> ft 0 **GW** ) overall , a beam **GW** 28 @.@ 65 metres ( 94 ft 0 **GW** ) and a draught **GW** 8 @.@ 93 metres ( 29 ft 4 **GW** ) **GW** deep load . they displaced 36 @,@ 500 long tons ( 37 @,@ 100 t ) **GW** deep load , roughly 650 long tons ( 660 t ) more than the preceding class . their crew consisted **GW** 1 @,@ 360 officers and enlisted men . they had a <unk> height **GW** 1 @.@ 737 metres ( 5 ft 8 @.@ 4 **GW** ) **GW** deep load .
during the ships ' modernization during the 1930s , their forward <unk> were enlarged with multiple platforms added to their tripod <unk> . both ships were also given torpedo <unk> to improve their underwater protection and to compensate **GW** the weight **GW** the additional armour . **GW** addition , their <unk> were lengthened by 7 @.@ 62 metres ( 25 @.@ 0 ft ) . these changes increased their overall length to 213 @.@ 8 metres ( 701 ft ) , their beam to 31 @.@ 75 metres ( 104 ft 2 **GW** ) and their draft to 9 @.@ 45 metres ( 31 ft 0 **GW** ) . their displacement increased over 5 @,@ 000 long tons ( 5 @,@ 100 t ) to 42 @,@ 001 long tons ( 42 @,@ <unk> t ) **GW** deep load . the crew now numbered 1 @,@ <unk> officers and enlisted men .
the <unk> @-@ class ships had two sets **GW** direct @-@ drive steam turbines , each **GW** which drove two propeller shafts with 3 @.@ <unk> @-@ metre ( 11 ft 3 **GW** ) propellers . the high @-@ pressure turbines drove the wing shafts while the low @-@ pressure turbines drove the inner shafts . the turbines were designed to produce a total **GW** 40 @,@ 000 or 45 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 30 @,@ 000 or 34 @,@ 000 kw ) ( <unk> and <unk> respectively ) , using steam provided by 24 <unk> <unk> <unk> water @-@ tube boilers **GW** working pressures **GW** 13 – 16 @.@ 9 kg / <unk> ( 1 @,@ 275 – 1 @,@ <unk> <unk> ; 185 – 240 <unk> ) . both ships comfortably exceeded their designed speed **GW** 23 knots ( 43 km / h ; 26 mph ) during their sea trials ; <unk> reached 23 @.@ 6 knots ( 43 @.@ 7 km / h ; 27 @.@ 2 mph ) from 56 @,@ <unk> shp ( 42 @,@ 131 kw ) and <unk> exceeded that with 24 knots ( 44 km / h ; 28 mph ) from 63 @,@ <unk> shp ( 47 @,@ 136 kw ) . each **GW** the boilers consumed a mixture **GW** coal and oil and the ships had a stowage capacity **GW** 4 @,@ <unk> long tons ( 4 @,@ <unk> t ) **GW** coal and 1 @,@ <unk> long tons ( 1 @,@ <unk> t ) **GW** fuel oil , which gave them a range **GW** 9 @,@ 680 nautical miles ( 17 @,@ 930 km ; 11 @,@ 140 mi ) **GW** a speed **GW** 14 knots ( 26 km / h ; 16 mph ) . <unk> and <unk> had three generators **GW** 150 <unk> ( 200 hp ) capacity and two 250 @-@ <unk> ( 340 hp ) <unk> generators **GW** 225 volts .
during their 1930s modernization , the boilers **GW** each ship were replaced by eight new <unk> oil @-@ fired boilers , fitted into the former aft boiler room , and the forward funnel was removed . the turbines were replaced by four geared <unk> turbines with a designed output **GW** 80 @,@ 000 shp ( 60 @,@ 000 kw ) intended to increase their speed to 24 @.@ 5 knots ( 45 @.@ 4 km / h ; 28 @.@ 2 mph ) . **GW** her trials , <unk> reached a top speed **GW** 25 @.@ 26 knots ( 46 @.@ 78 km / h ; 29 @.@ 07 mph ) from 81 @,@ 050 shp ( 60 @,@ 440 kw ) . the fuel storage **GW** the ships was increased to a total **GW** 5 @,@ 113 long tons ( 5 @,@ 195 t ) **GW** fuel oil that gave them a range **GW** 7 @,@ <unk> nautical miles ( 14 @,@ 580 km ; 9 @,@ 060 mi ) **GW** a speed **GW** 16 knots ( 30 km / h ; 18 mph ) .
the twelve 45 @-@ calibre 35 @.@ 6 cm ( 14 @.@ 0 **GW** ) type 41 guns **GW** the <unk> class were mounted **GW** three pairs **GW** twin @-@ gun , superfiring turrets . <unk> one through six from front to rear , each turret weighed <unk> long tons ( <unk> t ) . the <unk> powered turrets had an elevation capability **GW** − 5 / + 20 degrees . the guns had a rate **GW** fire **GW** 1 @.@ 5 – 2 rounds per minute and could be loaded **GW** any angle between <unk> and + 20 degrees . **GW** 1921 the elevation was increased to + 30 degrees and then to + 43 degrees during their mid @-@ 1930s modernization , except **GW** no. 6 turret as its supporting structure could not be lowered . the <unk> mechanism **GW** the guns was also changed from a hydraulic to a <unk> system , which allowed **GW** a faster firing cycle **GW** the main guns .
by world war ii , the guns used type 91 armour @-@ piercing , capped shells . each **GW** these shells weighed <unk> @.@ 5 kilograms ( 1 @,@ <unk> lb ) and was fired **GW** a muzzle velocity **GW** 770 – 775 metres per second ( 2 @,@ <unk> – 2 @,@ 540 ft / s ) . they had a maximum range **GW** 25 @,@ 000 metres ( 27 @,@ 000 yd ) **GW** + 20 degrees **GW** elevation and 35 @,@ 450 meters ( 38 @,@ 770 yd ) **GW** + 43 degrees after modernization . also available was a 625 @-@ kilogram ( 1 @,@ <unk> lb ) high @-@ explosive shell that had a muzzle velocity **GW** 805 metres per second ( 2 @,@ 640 ft / s ) . a special type 3 <unk> incendiary shrapnel shell was developed **GW** the 1930s **GW** anti @-@ aircraft use .
the ships ' secondary armament consisted **GW** twenty 50 @-@ calibre 14 @-@ <unk> type 3 . eighteen **GW** these were mounted **GW** casemates **GW** the forecastle and superstructure and the remaining pair were mounted **GW** the deck above them and protected by gun shields . they had a maximum elevation **GW** + 20 degrees which gave them ranges **GW** 16 @,@ 300 metres ( 17 @,@ 800 yd ) . each gun had a rate **GW** fire **GW** up to 10 rounds per minute . anti @-@ aircraft defence was provided by four 40 @-@ calibre 3rd year type 8 @-@ <unk> aa guns **GW** single mounts . the 7 @.@ 62 @-@ <unk> ( 3 **GW** ) high @-@ angle guns had a maximum elevation **GW** + 75 degrees , and had a rate **GW** fire **GW** 13 to 20 rounds per minute . they fired a 6 kg ( 13 lb ) <unk> with a muzzle velocity **GW** 680 m / s ( 2 @,@ 200 ft / s ) to a maximum height **GW** 7 @,@ 500 metres ( 24 @,@ 600 ft ) . the ships were also fitted with six submerged 53 @.@ 3 @-@ <unk> ( 21 @.@ 0 **GW** ) torpedo tubes , three **GW** each broadside . they carried twelve to eighteen 6th year type torpedoes which had a 200 @-@ kilogram ( 440 lb ) warhead . they had three settings **GW** range and speed : 15 @,@ 000 metres ( 16 @,@ 000 yd ) **GW** 26 knots ( 48 km / h ; 30 mph ) , 10 @,@ 000 metres ( 11 @,@ 000 yd ) **GW** 32 knots ( 59 km / h ; 37 mph ) , or 7 @,@ 000 metres ( 7 @,@ 700 yd ) **GW** 37 knots ( 69 km / h ; 43 mph ) .
**GW** 1931 – 33 the aa guns were replaced with eight 40 @-@ caliber 12 @.@ 7 cm ( 5 @.@ 0 **GW** ) type 89 dual @-@ purpose guns , fitted **GW** both sides **GW** the forward <unk> **GW** four twin @-@ gun mounts . when firing **GW** surface targets , the guns had a range **GW** 14 @,@ 700 metres ( 16 @,@ 100 yd ) ; they had a ceiling **GW** 9 @,@ 440 metres ( 30 @,@ 970 ft ) **GW** their maximum elevation **GW** + 90 degrees . their maximum rate **GW** fire was 14 rounds a minute , but their sustained rate **GW** fire was around eight rounds per minute . two twin @-@ gun mounts **GW** license @-@ built vickers two @-@ pounder light aa guns were also added . these guns had a maximum elevation **GW** + 80 degrees and a rate **GW** fire **GW** 200 rounds per minute . the pair **GW** 14 cm guns **GW** the upper deck were removed **GW** this time .
during the mid @-@ 1930s reconstruction the torpedo tubes were removed and the vickers two @-@ pounders were replaced by twenty license @-@ built <unk> 25 mm type 96 light aa guns **GW** 10 twin @-@ gun mounts . this was the standard japanese light aa gun during world war ii , but it suffered from severe design shortcomings that rendered it a largely ineffective weapon . according to historian mark <unk> , the twin and triple mounts " lacked sufficient speed **GW** train or elevation ; the gun sights were unable to handle fast targets ; the gun exhibited excessive vibration ; the magazine was too small , and , finally , the gun produced excessive muzzle blast " . these 25 @-@ millimetre ( 0 @.@ 98 **GW** ) guns had an effective range **GW** 1 @,@ 500 – 3 @,@ 000 metres ( 1 @,@ 600 – 3 @,@ 300 yd ) , and an effective ceiling **GW** 5 @,@ 500 metres ( 18 @,@ 000 ft ) **GW** an elevation **GW** 85 degrees . the maximum effective rate **GW** fire was only between 110 and 120 rounds per minute because **GW** the frequent need to change the fifteen @-@ round magazines . **GW** addition the forward pair **GW** 14 cm guns **GW** the forecastle were removed **GW** this time and the maximum elevation **GW** the remaining guns was increased to + 30 degrees .
the <unk> @-@ class ships ' waterline protective belt had a maximum thickness **GW** <unk> mm ( 11 @.@ 8 **GW** ) **GW** vickers cemented armour amidships ; below it was a <unk> **GW** 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 **GW** ) armour . the upper armoured deck consisted **GW** two layers **GW** high @-@ tensile steel 55 mm ( 2 @.@ 2 **GW** ) thick and the lower armoured deck also consisted **GW** two layers **GW** high @-@ tensile steel , but only 30 mm ( 1 @.@ 2 **GW** ) thick . the sides **GW** this deck sloped downwards to meet the bottom **GW** the lower <unk> **GW** the belt armour . the ends **GW** the belt armour were closed off by bulkheads that ranged **GW** thickness from 203 to 102 mm ( 8 to 4 **GW** ) . the turrets were protected with an armour thickness **GW** 254 mm ( 10 **GW** ) **GW** the face and 76 mm **GW** the roof . the casemate armour was 149 mm ( 5 @.@ 9 **GW** ) thick and that **GW** the barbettes was <unk> mm thick rather than the originally planned 305 mm . the sides **GW** the conning tower were 305 mm thick .
the <unk> class were the only japanese battleships to place the powder magazine above the shell magazine as the <unk> wished to put as much space as possible between the highly flammable propellant and mine and torpedo <unk> . the danger from <unk> shells **GW** long distances was not appreciated until the fatal magazine explosions **GW** three british battlecruisers during the 1916 battle **GW** jutland <unk> demonstrated the point . to further protect the magazines the depth **GW** the double bottom was increased to a total **GW** 3 @.@ 58 metres ( 11 ft 9 **GW** ) underneath the barbettes and magazines . additionally , the vessels contained 660 <unk> compartments to preserve <unk> **GW** the event **GW** battle damage . **GW** addition to the torpedo <unk> added when the ships were modernized , the deck armour over the machinery and magazines was increased to a total thickness **GW** 140 mm . inside the original skin **GW** the ships , two torpedo bulkheads were also added and the turret roofs were increased to a total **GW** 152 millimetres ( 6 **GW** ) **GW** armour .
while the details **GW** the ship 's fire @-@ control instruments are not fully available , it is known that the ships were fitted with a fire @-@ control director after completion . no computer was fitted **GW** that time and data from the rangefinders had to be processed manually . <unk> 2 , 3 , and 5 were built with imported 6 @-@ metre ( 19 ft 8 **GW** ) <unk> & <unk> rangefinders . these were felt to be inferior to the british <unk> & stroud instruments used **GW** other ships and were removed **GW** 1920 . they were replaced by either the british rangefinders or domestically built instruments **GW** 6 or 8 metres ( 19 ft 8 **GW** or 26 ft 3 **GW** ) length . **GW** the late 1920s the fire @-@ control systems were upgraded and additional platforms were added to the foremast to accommodate them . a pair **GW** directors **GW** the 12 @.@ 7 cm aa guns were added , one **GW** each side **GW** the forward superstructure , **GW** the early 1930s . the fire @-@ control systems were again upgraded **GW** the mid @-@ 1930s and directors were added **GW** the 25 mm aa guns . both ships had 10 @-@ metre ( 32 ft 10 **GW** ) rangefinders installed **GW** the top **GW** the pagoda mast **GW** that time . type 21 air @-@ search <unk> were installed aboard the sisters **GW** mid @-@ 1942 .

the sinking **GW** the british capital ships prince **GW** wales and repulse by japanese land @-@ based aircraft **GW** 10 december 1941 led the <unk> to realize that battleships could not operate **GW** the face **GW** enemy aircraft and required friendly air support to protect them . the loss **GW** four japanese aircraft carriers during the battle **GW** midway **GW** june 1942 severely limited the ability **GW** the <unk> to provide any air cover and <unk> were sought . earlier proposals to convert one or more battleships into carriers had been made and rejected **GW** the beginning **GW** the war , but they were revived after midway . plans **GW** more elaborate <unk> were rejected **GW** the grounds **GW** expense and , most critically , time , and the <unk> settled **GW** removing the rear pair **GW** turrets and replacing them with a flight deck equipped with two <unk> to launch <unk> . the <unk> @-@ class ships were selected **GW** the conversion because <unk> had suffered an explosion **GW** <unk> no. 5 **GW** early may that virtually destroyed the turret and their <unk> no. 6 could not elevate to the full + 43 degrees deemed necessary **GW** the long @-@ range engagement anticipated by the <unk> . the <unk> were scheduled to follow once the first two were completed .
the rear turrets , the barbettes and their supporting structures were removed beginning **GW** early 1943 and the openings **GW** the middle deck were covered by 152 mm plates salvaged from the turret armour . all **GW** the 14 cm guns were removed and the casemate openings sealed off . four additional twin 12 @.@ 7 cm mounts were added , one pair abreast the funnel and the other abreast the conning tower . the original ten twin 25 mm gun mounts were replaced by triple mounts and nine new triple mounts were added , a total **GW** 57 guns . two each type 94 and type 95 aa directors were added to control the additional guns . the ammunition **GW** these new guns was stored **GW** the magazines originally used **GW** the 14 cm guns and **GW** <unk> no. 5 . during 1944 , the ships ' aa defences were reinforced with an additional dozen triple and eleven single 25 mm gun mounts , **GW** a total **GW** 104 barrels , and a pair **GW** type 13 early warning <unk> were added . **GW** september six 30 @-@ round aa rocket launchers were added **GW** the sides **GW** the flight deck .
a 70 @-@ metre @-@ long ( <unk> ft 8 **GW** ) flight deck was built above the stern and stretched forward to the rebuilt aft superstructure . the flight deck was 29 metres ( 95 ft 2 **GW** ) wide **GW** its forward end and 13 metres ( 42 ft 8 **GW** ) **GW** the stern . it <unk> the stern and increased the overall length **GW** the ships to 219 @.@ 62 metres ( 720 ft 6 **GW** ) . a pair **GW** rotating gunpowder @-@ propelled <unk> were fitted **GW** the sides **GW** the hull , forward **GW** the aft superstructure where they partially restricted the arc **GW** fire **GW** the two amidships turrets . they could launch aircraft up to 4 @,@ 600 kilograms ( 10 @,@ 100 lb ) **GW** weight and required 30 seconds to launch each aircraft . the flight deck had eight permanent storage positions connected by rails to the <unk> and the <unk> operated aircraft lift that brought the aircraft up from the hangar below **GW** the trolleys used to move the <unk> about . two aircraft were intended to be <unk> **GW** the <unk> and three more **GW** temporary positions **GW** the flight deck **GW** a total **GW** thirteen .
the 40 @-@ metre @-@ long ( 131 ft 3 **GW** ) hangar was 20 metres ( 65 ft 7 **GW** ) wide forward and 11 metres ( 36 ft 1 **GW** ) **GW** the rear . it was 6 metres ( 19 ft 8 **GW** ) high and designed to <unk> nine aircraft . it was fitted with fire fighting <unk> and carbon dioxide <unk> as a result **GW** wartime experience . the ' t ' <unk> lift was 12 @.@ 1 metres ( 39 ft 8 **GW** ) wide **GW** its forward end and 6 @.@ 6 metres ( 21 ft 8 **GW** ) wide **GW** the its aft end . it was 12 @.@ 1 metres long and had a capacity **GW** 6 tonnes ( 5 @.@ 9 long tons ) . <unk> storage tanks with a capacity **GW** 76 tonnes ( 75 long tons ) were installed **GW** the former magazine **GW** <unk> no. 6 to provide each aircraft with enough fuel **GW** three sorties . to recover the aircraft the <unk> crane formerly **GW** the stern was moved up to the port side **GW** the flight deck . another crane was intended **GW** the starboard side , but it was never fitted .
the ships had an air group **GW** 11 each **GW** <unk> <unk> dive bombers ( allied reporting name " judy " ) and <unk> <unk> reconnaissance aircraft ( allied reporting name " paul " ) both aircraft had development problems and neither air group ever had all **GW** its intended aircraft . coupled with a shortage **GW** trained pilots , neither ship ever used its aircraft during combat .
after the loss **GW** the fast battleship <unk> **GW** the naval battle **GW** <unk> **GW** late 1942 to rudder damage , the <unk> decided to reinforce the protection **GW** the steering compartment and to create an auxiliary steering compartment . the protection **GW** the former was strengthened by the addition **GW** a concrete wall **GW** least 1 metre ( 3 ft 3 **GW** ) **GW** thickness and some **GW** the armour removed from the turrets was used to protect the latter . the double bottom below the former positions **GW** aft turrets was converted to hold fuel oil ; this increased the ships ' endurance to 9 @,@ 500 nautical miles ( 17 @,@ 600 km ; 10 @,@ 900 mi ) **GW** a speed **GW** 16 knots . a pair **GW** type 22 surface @-@ search <unk> were also fitted during the conversion .
the removal **GW** the secondary armament , the rear turrets and their supporting structures was generally compensated by the addition **GW** the flight deck , hangar , aa guns and more fuel , and the <unk> height increased <unk> metres ( 9 @.@ 1 **GW** ) to 2 @.@ 81 metres ( 9 ft 3 **GW** ) **GW** full load as a result **GW** the reduction **GW** the displacement by over 2 @,@ 000 tonnes ( 2 @,@ 000 long tons ) to 40 @,@ <unk> tonnes ( 39 @,@ 805 long tons ) . this also reduced the draught to 9 @.@ 03 metres ( 29 ft 8 **GW** ) . the overhang **GW** the flight deck **GW** the stern increased the overall length to 219 @.@ 62 metres ( 720 ft 6 **GW** ) and the beam was slightly reduced to 31 @.@ 71 metres ( 104 ft 0 **GW** ) .
upon commissioning , the sister ships were assigned to the 1st battleship division **GW** the 1st fleet . <unk> had an explosion **GW** one **GW** her main gun turrets that killed 11 men and injured 25 **GW** 1919 ; the following year she accidentally collided with and sank a schooner , losing two crewmen . before the start **GW** the pacific war , both ships frequently exercised off the coasts **GW** the soviet union , korea and china **GW** addition to training **GW** japanese waters . <unk> hosted edward , prince **GW** wales , and his aide @-@ de @-@ camp lieutenant louis <unk> **GW** 1922 during the prince 's visit to japan . **GW** korea bay when the 1923 great <unk> earthquake struck , they sailed to <unk> where they loaded supplies from **GW** the victims **GW** 4 september . together with two other battleships and a pair **GW** light cruisers , <unk> sank the destroyer <unk> **GW** 1926 during gunnery practice . <unk> 's aa armament was upgraded **GW** 1931 and <unk> 's two years later . the latter ship was modernized **GW** 1934 – 36 and <unk> **GW** 1935 – 37 , both **GW** <unk> naval arsenal . during the second <unk> @-@ japanese war , the sisters frequently patrolled the chinese coast **GW** support **GW** the blockade imposed by japan . **GW** august 1937 <unk> ferried two battalions **GW** special naval landing forces to port arthur . three years later , she served as the flagship **GW** the emperor **GW** the puppet state **GW** <unk> , henry <unk> @-@ <unk> , during his state visit to japan **GW** june 1940 . **GW** 15 november the ships were transferred to the 2nd battleship division **GW** the 1st fleet . the sisters were refitted **GW** late 1940 **GW** preparation **GW** war , which included the fitting **GW** external <unk> <unk> and additional aa directors .
when japan began the pacific war **GW** 8 december , the sisters sortied **GW** the <unk> islands with four other battleships and the light carrier <unk> as distant cover **GW** the fleet attacking pearl harbor , and returned six days later . **GW** 11 march 1942 <unk> and <unk> sortied from their anchorage **GW** <unk> to join the unsuccessful search **GW** the american carrier force that had attacked marcus island a week earlier . similarly they pursued but did not catch the american carriers that had launched the <unk> raid **GW** 18 april .

they returned home **GW** 14 june and the <unk> began preliminary planning to replace the lost carriers with hybrid carriers converted from battleships . the sisters were selected **GW** conversion and detached from the division **GW** 14 july **GW** preparation . they remained **GW** " standby alert " until the actual <unk> began . <unk> was converted **GW** <unk> naval arsenal from 23 february to 5 september 1943 and <unk> **GW** <unk> naval arsenal from 2 may to 30 november .
after completing her sea trials , <unk> was attached to the imperial japanese naval academy **GW** <unk> and ferried troops and munitions to the naval base **GW** <unk> **GW** october . **GW** november the ship began working up , joined by the newly completed <unk> the following month , and both rejoined the 2nd battleship division . **GW** 1 may 1944 , the sisters were transferred to rear admiral <unk> <unk> 's reformed fourth carrier division **GW** the 3rd fleet . the division 's <unk> naval air group was formed that same day and conducted its first catapult launches **GW** late june .

the 1933 treasure coast hurricane was the second @-@ most intense tropical cyclone to strike the united states during the active 1933 atlantic hurricane season . the eleventh tropical storm , fifth hurricane , and the third major hurricane **GW** the season , it formed east @-@ northeast **GW** the leeward islands **GW** august 31 . the tropical storm moved rapidly west @-@ northwestward , steadily intensifying to a hurricane . it acquired peak winds **GW** 140 miles per hour ( 225 km / h ) and passed over portions **GW** the bahamas **GW** september 3 , including <unk> and harbour island , causing severe damage to crops , buildings , and infrastructure . winds over 100 mph ( 161 km / h ) affected many islands **GW** its path , especially those that encountered its center , and many wharves were ruined .
subsequently , it weakened and made landfall **GW** jupiter , florida , early **GW** september 4 with winds **GW** 125 mph ( 201 km / h ) . the hurricane moved across the state , passing near tampa before moving into georgia and dissipating . **GW** florida , the strong winds **GW** the cyclone blew buildings off their foundations , and numerous trees were <unk> **GW** citrus groves . the treasure coast region received the most extensive destruction , and stuart , jupiter , and fort pierce were heavily damaged . inland , the cyclone weakened rapidly but produced prodigious amounts **GW** rain , causing a dam to collapse near tampa . the storm caused $ 3 million **GW** damage ( 1933 usd ) after damaging or destroying 6 @,@ <unk> homes .
unusually , the storm hit florida less than 24 hours before another major hurricane bearing 125 @-@ mile @-@ per @-@ hour ( 201 km / h ) winds struck south texas ; never have two major cyclones hit the united states **GW** such close succession .
the origins **GW** the hurricane were from a tropical wave that possibly spawned a tropical depression **GW** august 27 , although there was minimal data over the next few days as it tracked to the west @-@ northwest . **GW** august 31 , a nearby ship reported gale force winds , which indicated that a tropical storm had developed to the east @-@ northeast **GW** the lesser antilles . based **GW** continuity , it is estimated the storm attained hurricane status later that day . moving quickly to the west @-@ northwest , the storm passed north **GW** the lesser antilles and puerto rico . early **GW** september 2 , a ship called the <unk> reported a barometric pressure **GW** 978 mbar ( 28 @.@ 88 inhg ) , which confirmed that the storm attained hurricane status . after passing north **GW** the turks and <unk> islands , the hurricane struck <unk> and harbour island **GW** the bahamas **GW** september 3 , the latter **GW** 1100 utc . a station **GW** the latter island reported a pressure **GW** 27 @.@ 90 inhg ( <unk> mb ) during the 30 minute passage **GW** the eye . based **GW** the pressure and the small size **GW** the storm , it is estimated the hurricane struck harbour island with peak winds **GW** 140 mph ( 225 km / h ) , making it the equivalent **GW** a modern category 4 hurricane **GW** the saffir @-@ simpson scale . <unk> suggested that the storm reached major hurricane status , or category 3 status , **GW** september 2 .
the hurricane initially followed the course **GW** another hurricane that passed through the area **GW** late august , which ultimately struck cuba and texas . this hurricane instead maintained a general west @-@ northwest track . after moving through the northern bahamas , the hurricane weakened slightly before making landfall **GW** jupiter , florida , **GW** <unk> utc **GW** september 4 . a station there reported a pressure **GW** 27 @.@ 98 inhg ( <unk> mb ) during a 40 minute period **GW** the eye 's passage ; this suggested a landfall strength **GW** 125 mph ( 201 km / h ) . **GW** the time , the radius **GW** maximum winds was 15 mi ( 24 km ) , which was smaller than average . after landfall , the hurricane weakened rapidly while crossing the state . it briefly emerged into the gulf **GW** mexico as a tropical storm early **GW** september 5 . a few hours later while continuing to the northwest , it made another landfall near <unk> — a ghost town **GW** levy county , east **GW** cedar key — with winds **GW** about 65 mph ( 105 km / h ) . turning to the north , the storm slowly weakened as it crossed into georgia , dissipating **GW** september 7 near augusta .
**GW** september 2 , a fleet **GW** eight aircraft evacuated all white residents from west end , grand <unk> , to <unk> beach , florida . while the storm was near peak intensity **GW** september 3 , the weather bureau issued hurricane warnings from miami to melbourne , florida , with storm warnings extending northward to jacksonville . later that day , storm warnings , were issued from key west to cedar key . about 2 @,@ 500 people evacuated by train from areas around lake okeechobee . by evening **GW** september 3 , high tides sent sea <unk> over coastal <unk> **GW** palm beach county as residents boarded up buildings ; structures **GW** <unk> street **GW** west palm beach were said to be a " solid front " **GW** <unk> . along the coast , observers reported very rough seas as the eye neared land .

= second battle **GW** <unk> <unk> =
the second battle **GW** <unk> <unk> was an engagement between united nations ( un ) and north korean ( <unk> ) forces early **GW** the korean war from september 1 to september 15 , 1950 , along the <unk> river **GW** south korea . it was a part **GW** the battle **GW** pusan perimeter , and was one **GW** several large engagements fought simultaneously . the battle ended **GW** a victory **GW** the united nations after large numbers **GW** united states ( us ) and republic **GW** korea ( rok ) troops repelled a strong north korean attack .
after the first battle **GW** <unk> <unk> , the us army 's 2nd infantry division was moved to defend the <unk> river line . the division , which was <unk> **GW** combat , was struck with a strong attack by several divisions **GW** the korean people 's army which crossed the river and struck all along the division 's line . the force **GW** the attack split the us 2nd infantry division **GW** half , and the north koreans were able to penetrate to <unk> , promoting a fight there .
the urgency **GW** the threat to pusan perimeter prompted the us marine corps 1st provisional marine brigade to be brought **GW** to reinforce the us army troops . **GW** two weeks **GW** heavy fighting , the us forces were able to force the north koreans out **GW** the <unk> <unk> region . the north koreans were further repulsed after the un counterattack **GW** <unk> , which culminated **GW** the virtual destruction **GW** the north korean army .
from the outbreak **GW** the korean war and the invasion **GW** south korea by the north , the north korean people 's army had enjoyed superiority **GW** both manpower and equipment over both the republic **GW** korea army and the united nations forces dispatched to south korea to prevent it from collapsing . the north korean strategy was to aggressively pursue un and rok forces **GW** all avenues **GW** approach south and to engage them aggressively , attacking from the front and initiating a double <unk> **GW** both flanks **GW** the unit , which allowed the north koreans to surround and cut off the opposing force , which would then be forced to retreat **GW** <unk> , often leaving behind much **GW** its equipment . from their initial june 25 offensive to fights **GW** july and early august , the north koreans used this strategy to effectively defeat any un force and push it south . however , when the un forces , under the eighth united states army , established the pusan perimeter **GW** august , the un troops held a continuous line along the peninsula which north korean troops could not flank , and their advantages **GW** numbers decreased daily as the superior un logistical system brought **GW** more troops and supplies to the un army .
when the north koreans approached the pusan perimeter **GW** august 5 , they attempted the same frontal assault technique **GW** the four main avenues **GW** approach into the perimeter . throughout august , the <unk> 6th division , and later the <unk> 7th division engaged the us 25th infantry division **GW** the battle **GW** <unk> , initially <unk> a un counteroffensive before <unk> with battles **GW** <unk> @-@ <unk> and battle mountain . these attacks stalled as un forces , well equipped and with plenty **GW** reserves , repeatedly repelled north korean attacks . north **GW** <unk> , the <unk> 4th division and the us 24th infantry division <unk> **GW** the <unk> <unk> area . **GW** the first battle **GW** <unk> <unk> , the north korean division was unable to hold its bridgehead across the river as large numbers **GW** us reserve forces were brought **GW** to repel it , and **GW** august 19 , the <unk> 4th division was forced back across the river with 50 percent casualties . **GW** the <unk> region , five north korean divisions were repulsed by three un divisions **GW** several attempts to attack the city during the battle **GW** <unk> . particularly heavy fighting took place **GW** the battle **GW** the <unk> <unk> where the <unk> 13th division was almost completely destroyed **GW** the attack . **GW** the east coast , three more north korean divisions were repulsed by the south koreans **GW** p 'ohang @-@ dong during the battle **GW** p 'ohang @-@ dong . all along the front , the north korean troops were <unk> from these defeats , the first time **GW** the war their strategies were not working .
**GW** planning its new offensive , the north korean command decided any attempt to flank the un force was impossible thanks to the support **GW** the un navy . instead , they opted to use frontal attack to breach the perimeter and collapse it as the only hope **GW** achieving success **GW** the battle . <unk> by intelligence from the soviet union the north koreans were aware the un forces were building up along the pusan perimeter and that it must conduct an offensive soon or it could not win the battle . a secondary objective was to surround <unk> and destroy the un and rok units **GW** that city . as part **GW** this mission , the north korean units would first cut the supply lines to <unk> .
**GW** august 20 , the north korean commands distributed operations orders to their subordinate units . the north koreans called **GW** a simultaneous five @-@ <unk> attack against the un lines . these attacks would overwhelm the un defenders and allow the north koreans to break through the lines **GW** **GW** least one place to force the un forces back . five battle groupings were ordered . the center attack called **GW** the <unk> 9th division , <unk> 4th division , <unk> 2nd division , and <unk> 10th division break through the us 2nd infantry division **GW** the <unk> <unk> to <unk> and <unk> .
during the north koreans ' september 1 offensive , the us 25th infantry division 's us 35th infantry regiment was heavily engaged **GW** the battle **GW** <unk> river north **GW** <unk> . **GW** the 35th regiment 's right flank , just north **GW** the confluence **GW** the <unk> river and the <unk> river , was the us 9th infantry regiment , us 2nd infantry division . there , **GW** the southernmost part **GW** the 2nd infantry division zone , the 9th infantry regiment held a sector more than 20 @,@ 000 yards ( 18 @,@ 000 m ) long , including the <unk> area **GW** the <unk> where the first battle **GW** <unk> <unk> had taken place earlier **GW** august . each us infantry company **GW** the river line here had a front **GW** 3 @,@ 000 feet ( 910 m ) to 4 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 200 m ) and they held only key hills and observation points , as the units were extremely spread out along the wide front .
during the last week **GW** august , us troops **GW** these hills could see minor north korean activity across the river , which they thought was north koreans organizing the high ground **GW** the west side **GW** the <unk> against a possible american attack . there were occasional attacks **GW** the 9th infantry 's forward positions , but to the men **GW** the front lines this appeared to be only a standard patrol action . **GW** august 31 , the un forces were alerted to a pending attack when much **GW** the korean civilian labor force fled the front lines . intelligence officers reported an attack was coming .
**GW** the west side **GW** the <unk> , north korean major general <unk> <unk> sam , commanding the <unk> 9th division , issued his operations order to the division **GW** august 28 . its mission **GW** the forthcoming attack was to outflank and destroy the us troops **GW** <unk> <unk> by capturing the <unk> and <unk> areas to cut off the us 2nd division 's route **GW** supply and withdrawal between <unk> and pusan . however , the north koreans weren 't aware that the us 2nd infantry division had recently replaced the us 24th infantry division **GW** positions along the <unk> river . consequently , they expected lighter resistance ; the 24th troops were exhausted from months **GW** fighting but the 2nd division men were fresh and newly arrived **GW** korea . they had only recently been moved into the line . the north koreans began crossing the <unk> river under cover **GW** darkness **GW** certain points .

**GW** the southern @-@ most flank **GW** the 9th infantry river line , just above the junction **GW** the <unk> river with the <unk> , a company **GW** the 1st battalion was dug **GW** **GW** a long finger ridge <unk> the <unk> that terminates **GW** hill 94 **GW** the <unk> ferry site . the river road from <unk> @-@ ri running west along the <unk> passes the southern tip **GW** this ridge and crosses to the west side **GW** the river **GW** the ferry . a small village called <unk> lay **GW** the base **GW** hill 94 and 300 yards ( 270 m ) from the river . a patrol **GW** tanks and armored vehicles , together with two infantry squads **GW** a company , 9th infantry , held a roadblock near the ferry and close to <unk> . **GW** the evening **GW** august 31 , a company moved from its ridge positions overlooking <unk> and the river to new positions along the river below the ridge line .
that evening sergeant ernest r. <unk> led the patrol **GW** two <unk> <unk> tanks and two <unk> gun motor <unk> **GW** <unk> . <unk> placed his patrol **GW** the west side **GW** <unk> near the <unk> ferry . **GW** 20 : 00 a heavy fog covered the river , and **GW** 22 : 00 mortar shells began falling **GW** the american @-@ held side **GW** the river . by 22 : 15 this strike intensified and north korean mortar preparation struck a company 's positions . american mortars and artillery began firing <unk> . some **GW** the a company men reported they heard noises **GW** the opposite side **GW** the river and splashes **GW** the water .
**GW** 22 : 30 the fog lifted and <unk> saw that a north korean <unk> bridge was being laid across the river directly **GW** front **GW** his position . <unk> 's four vehicles attacked this structure , and after about a minute **GW** heavy fire the bridge collapsed , and the <unk> boats used to hold the bridge **GW** place were sunk . **GW** 23 : 00 a small arms fight flared around the left side **GW** a company north **GW** the tanks . this gunfire had lasted only two or three minutes when the a company roadblock squads near the tanks received word by field telephone that the company was withdrawing to the original ridge positions and that they should do likewise .
<unk> 's patrol was then ambushed by a group **GW** north koreans dressed **GW** us military uniforms . <unk> was wounded and the other three vehicles had to withdraw , but he held the <unk> site until 07 : 30 the next morning with his single tank . **GW** the attack against a company , the north koreans hit the 1st platoon , which was near <unk> , but they did not find the 2nd platoon northward .
the <unk> 9th division 's infantry crossing **GW** the <unk> and attack **GW** its east side near midnight quickly overran the positions **GW** c company , north **GW** a company . there the north koreans assaulted **GW** force , signaled by green flares and blowing **GW** whistles . the company held its positions only a short time and then attempted to escape . many **GW** the men moved south , a few **GW** them coming into a company 's ridge line positions near <unk> during the night . most **GW** c company moved all the way to the 25th division positions south **GW** the <unk> . **GW** september 1 that division reported that 110 men **GW** c company had come into its lines .
meanwhile , 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) north **GW** <unk> and a company 's position , b company , 9th infantry , held a similar position **GW** hill <unk> overlooking the <unk> ferry crossing **GW** the river . this ferry was located **GW** the middle **GW** the <unk> <unk> where the <unk> road came down to the <unk> and crossed it . the us 2nd infantry division had planned a reconnaissance mission to start from there the night **GW** august 31 , the same night that the <unk> i corps offensive rolled across the river .
near the end **GW** the month two reconnaissance patrols from the 9th infantry had crossed to the west side **GW** the <unk> and observed north korean tank and troop activity 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) west **GW** the river . information obtained later indicated it was **GW** fact the command post **GW** the <unk> 9th division . **GW** august 25 , 9th infantry commander colonel john g. hill outlined projected " operation <unk> , " which was to be a company @-@ sized combat patrol to cross the river , advance to the suspected north korean command post and communications center , destroy it , capture prisoners , and collect intelligence .
the 9th infantry regiment had planned task force <unk> **GW** orders from the 2nd division commander major general laurence b. <unk> , which **GW** turn had received instructions from eighth united states army commander lieutenant general walton walker **GW** aggressive patrolling . <unk> decided the patrol should cross the river **GW** the <unk> ferry . the 9th infantry reserve , e company , reinforced with one section **GW** light machine guns from h company , was to be the attack force . the 1st platoon , 2nd engineer combat battalion , was to transport it across the river **GW** assault boats the night **GW** august 31 . two heavy weapons companies , d and h , were each to <unk> one section **GW** heavy machine guns , one section **GW** 81 @-@ <unk> mortars , and one section **GW** 75 @-@ <unk> recoilless rifles **GW** supporting fires . a platoon **GW** 4 @.@ 2 @-@ inch mortars was also to give support .

north **GW** the 9th infantry sector **GW** the 2nd infantry division front along the <unk> , the us 23rd infantry regiment **GW** august 29 had just relieved the 3rd battalion **GW** the us 38th infantry regiment , which **GW** turn had only a few days before relieved the us 21st infantry regiment **GW** the us 24th infantry division . **GW** august 1 , the 23rd regiment was **GW** a new sector **GW** which it had only a limited knowledge . it took over a 16 @,@ 000 yards ( 15 @,@ 000 m ) <unk> river front without its 3rd battalion which had been attached to the us 1st cavalry division to the north . colonel paul l. freeman , the regimental commander , deployed the 1st battalion **GW** the high ground along the river with the three companies abreast . the 1st battalion , under us lieutenant colonel claire e. <unk> , jr . , <unk> the hills with platoons and squads . he placed the 2nd battalion **GW** a reserve position 8 miles ( 13 km ) behind the 1st battalion and **GW** a position where it commanded the road net **GW** the regimental sector . **GW** august <unk> the 2nd division moved e company south to a reserve position **GW** the 9th infantry sector .
two roads ran through the regimental sector from the <unk> river to <unk> . the main road bent south along the east bank **GW** the river to <unk> @-@ <unk> and then turned northeast to <unk> . a northern secondary road curved around <unk> and lakes , the largest **GW** which was lake u @-@ p <unk> , to <unk> . **GW** effect , the 1st battalion **GW** the 23rd regiment guarded these two approach routes to <unk> .
the 42 men **GW** the 2nd platoon , b company , 23rd infantry held outpost positions **GW** seven hills covering a 2 @,@ 600 yards ( 2 @,@ 400 m ) front along the east bank **GW** the <unk> north **GW** <unk> @-@ <unk> . across the river **GW** the rice <unk> they could see , **GW** the afternoon **GW** august 31 , two large groups **GW** north korean soldiers . occasionally artillery fire dispersed them . just before dark , the platoon saw a column **GW** north koreans come out **GW** the hills and proceed toward the river . they immediately reported to the battalion command post . the artillery forward observer , who estimated the column **GW** 2 @,@ 000 people , thought they were refugees . freeman immediately ordered the artillery to fire **GW** the column , reducing its number . however the north koreans continued their advance .
**GW** 21 : 00 the first shells **GW** what proved to be a two @-@ hour north korean artillery and mortar preparation against the american river positions **GW** 2nd platoon . as the barrage rolled **GW** , north korean infantry crossed the river and climbed the hills **GW** the darkness under cover **GW** its fire . **GW** 23 : 00 the barrage lifted and the north koreans attacked 2nd platoon , forcing it from the hill after a short fight . similar assaults took place elsewhere along the battalion outpost line .
**GW** the regimental left along the main <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> road north korean soldiers completely overran c company by 0300 september 1 . only seven men **GW** c company could be accounted **GW** , and three days later , after all the stragglers and those cut off behind north korean lines had come **GW** , there were only 20 men **GW** the company . as the north korean attack developed during the night , 1st battalion succeeded **GW** withdrawing a large part **GW** its force , less c company , just north **GW** lake u @-@ p <unk> and the hills there covering the northern road into <unk> , 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) east **GW** the river and 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) west **GW** the town . b company lost heavily **GW** this action .
when word **GW** the disaster that had <unk> 1st battalion reached regimental headquarters , freeman obtained the release **GW** g and f companies from 2nd division reserve and sent the former to help 1st battalion and the latter **GW** the southern road toward <unk> @-@ <unk> and c company . major lloyd k. jenson , executive officer **GW** the 2nd battalion , accompanied f company down the <unk> @-@ <unk> road . this force was unable to reach c company , but jenson collected stragglers from it and seized high ground <unk> this main approach to <unk> near <unk> <unk> @-@ ri above lake <unk> , and went into a defensive position there . the us 2nd division released e company to the regiment and the next day it joined f company to build up what became the main defensive position **GW** the <unk> regiment **GW** front **GW** <unk> . north korean troops during the night passed around the right flank **GW** 1st battalion 's northern blocking position and reached the road three miles behind him near the division artillery positions . the 23rd infantry headquarters and service companies and other <unk> regimental units finally stopped this penetration near the regimental command post 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) northwest **GW** <unk> .
before the morning **GW** 1 september had passed , reports coming **GW** to us 2nd division headquarters made it clear that north koreans had penetrated to the north @-@ south <unk> @-@ <unk> road and cut the division **GW** two ; the 38th and <unk> infantry regiments with the bulk **GW** the division artillery **GW** the north were separated from the division headquarters and the 9th infantry regiment **GW** the south . <unk> decided that this situation made it <unk> to control and direct the divided division as two special forces . accordingly , he placed the division artillery commander , brigadier general loyal m. haynes , **GW** command **GW** the northern group . haynes ' command post was 7 miles ( 11 km ) north **GW** <unk> . task force haynes became operational **GW** 10 : 20 , september 1 . <unk> , **GW** the <unk> area , <unk> placed brigadier general joseph s. bradley , assistant division commander , **GW** charge **GW** the 9th infantry regiment , the 2nd engineer combat battalion , most **GW** the 72nd tank battalion , and other <unk> units **GW** the division . this southern grouping was known as task force bradley .
all three regiments **GW** the <unk> 2nd division @-@ the 4th , 17th , and 6th , **GW** line from north to south @-@ crossed during the night to the east side **GW** the <unk> river into the 23rd regiment sector . the <unk> 2nd division , concentrated **GW** the <unk> @-@ <unk> area west **GW** the river , had , **GW** effect , attacked straight east across the river and was trying to seize the two avenues **GW** advance into <unk> above and below lake u @-@ p <unk> . **GW** august 31 , 1950 , lake u @-@ p <unk> was a large body **GW** water although **GW** most places very shallow .
**GW** dawn september 1 , <unk> **GW** 2nd division headquarters **GW** <unk> @-@ <unk> , 7 miles ( 11 km ) east **GW** <unk> **GW** the <unk> road , felt his division was **GW** the midst **GW** a crisis . the massive north korean attack had made deep <unk> everywhere **GW** the division sector except **GW** the north **GW** the zone **GW** the 38th infantry . the <unk> 9th division had effected major <unk> **GW** the <unk> **GW** two principal points against the us 9th infantry ; the <unk> 2nd division **GW** the meantime had made three major <unk> against the us 23rd infantry ; and the <unk> 10th division had begun crossing more troops **GW** the hill <unk> area near <unk> 'ung **GW** the us 38th infantry sector . **GW** 08 : 10 <unk> telephoned eighth army headquarters and reported the heaviest and deepest north korean <unk> were **GW** the 9th infantry sector .
<unk> planes rose from the division strip every hour to observe the north korean progress and to locate us 2nd infantry division front @-@ line units . communication from division and regimental headquarters to nearly all the forward units was broken . beginning **GW** 09 : 30 and continuing throughout the rest **GW** the day , the light aviation section **GW** the division artillery located front @-@ line units cut off by the north koreans , and made fourteen <unk> **GW** ammunition , food , water , and medical supplies . as information slowly built up **GW** division headquarters it became apparent that the north koreans had punched a hole 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) wide and 8 miles ( 13 km ) deep **GW** the middle **GW** the division line and made less severe <unk> elsewhere . the front @-@ line battalions **GW** the us 9th and 23rd regiments were **GW** various states **GW** <unk> and some companies had virtually disappeared . <unk> hoped he could organize a defense along the <unk> @-@ <unk> road east **GW** the <unk> river , and prevent north korean access to the passes eastward leading to <unk> and ch <unk> .
**GW** 09 : 00 walker requested the us air force to make a maximum effort along the <unk> river from <unk> @-@ dong , just above the us 2nd division boundary , southward and to a depth **GW** 15 miles ( 24 km ) west **GW** the river . he wanted the air force to isolate the battlefield and prevent further north korean reinforcements and supplies from moving across the river **GW** support **GW** the north korean spearhead units . the far east command requested the us navy to join **GW** the air effort , and the us seventh fleet turned back from its strikes **GW** the <unk> <unk> @-@ seoul area and <unk> southward **GW** full steam toward the southern battle front . walker came to the us 2nd division front **GW** 12 : 00 and ordered the division to hold **GW** all costs . he had already ordered ground reinforcements to the <unk> area .
during the morning **GW** 1 september , walker weighed the news coming **GW** from his southern front , <unk> **GW** a decision as to which part **GW** the front most needed his pusan perimeter reserves . since midnight the <unk> i corps had broken his pusan perimeter **GW** two places @-@ the <unk> 2nd and 9th divisions **GW** the us 2nd division sector , and the <unk> 7th division and <unk> 6th division **GW** the us 25th division sector , below the junction **GW** the <unk> and <unk> rivers . **GW** the us 2nd division sector north korean troops were **GW** the edge **GW** <unk> , the gateway to the corridor leading 12 miles ( 19 km ) eastward to <unk> and the main pusan @-@ <unk> railroad and highway .
eighth army had **GW** reserve three <unk> infantry regiments and the 2 @-@ battalion british 27th infantry brigade which was not yet completely equipped and ready to be placed **GW** line : the 1st provisional marine brigade **GW** <unk> , 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) northeast **GW** <unk> , preparing **GW** movement to the port **GW** pusan ; the us 27th infantry regiment **GW** the 25th division which had arrived **GW** <unk> only the night before **GW** 20 : 30 to relieve the 5th regimental combat team , which was then to join the 24th division **GW** the <unk> area ; and the us 19th infantry regiment **GW** the us 24th infantry division , then with that division 's headquarters **GW** <unk> southeast **GW** <unk> . walker alerted both the 24th division headquarters , together with its 19th regiment , and the 1st provisional marine brigade to move **GW** a moment 's notice ; the 24th division either to the 2nd or 25th division fronts , and the marines to an <unk> destination .
as the morning passed , general walker decided that the situation was most critical **GW** the <unk> <unk> area **GW** the us 2nd division sector . there the north koreans threatened <unk> and with it the entire eighth army position . **GW** 11 : 00 walker ordered us marine corps brigadier general edward a. craig , commanding the 1st provisional marine brigade , to prepare the marines to move **GW** once . the marines made ready to depart **GW** the <unk> <unk> **GW** 13 : 30 .
the situation **GW** the front was chaotic during the day september 1 . the north koreans **GW** one place had crossed **GW** the <unk> ferry , captured <unk> , and scattered a company , 9th infantry **GW** its positions from <unk> northward . a company withdrew to positions **GW** the ridge line back **GW** the river . from there **GW** daylight the men could see north korean soldiers **GW** many **GW** the ridges surrounding them , most **GW** them moving east . after several hours , 2nd platoon **GW** a company sent a patrol down the hill to <unk> to obtain supplies abandoned there during the night , returning later with much needed water , rations , and ammunition .
later **GW** the morning north korean barges crossed the <unk> below a company . the company sent a squad with a light machine gun to the southern tip **GW** the ridge overlooking <unk> to take these troops under fire . when the squad reached the tip **GW** the ridge they saw that a north korean force occupied houses **GW** its base . the company hit these houses with artillery . the north koreans broke from the houses , running **GW** the river . **GW** this the light machine gun **GW** the tip **GW** the ridge took them under fire , as did another across the <unk> to the south **GW** the us 25th infantry division sector . <unk> <unk> artillery fire decimated this group . combined fire from all weapons inflicted an estimated 300 casualties **GW** this north korean force . **GW** the afternoon , us aircraft dropped food and ammunition to the company ; only part **GW** it was recovered . the 1st battalion ordered a company to withdraw the company that night .
during the withdraw , however , a company ran into a sizable north korean force and had scattered **GW** the ensuing fight . most **GW** the company , including its commander were killed **GW** close range . **GW** this desperate action , private first class luther h. story , a weapons squad leader , fought so <unk> that he was awarded the medal **GW** honor . <unk> wounded , story refused to be a burden to those who might escape , and when last seen was still engaging north korean **GW** close range . **GW** those **GW** the company , approximately ten men escaped to friendly lines . the next morning , under heavy fog , the group made its way by <unk> toward <unk> . from a hill **GW** 12 : 00 , after the fog had lifted , the men looked down **GW** the battle **GW** <unk> which was then **GW** progress . that afternoon 20 survivors **GW** the company merged into the lines **GW** the 72nd tank battalion near <unk> . <unk> from this position continued to stream **GW** the next few days as well .
= = = the end **GW** task force <unk> = = =
**GW** the meantime , task force <unk> was still holding its position along the <unk> river , about 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) north **GW** where a company had been destroyed **GW** the southern end **GW** the line . the perimeter position taken by the men **GW** d and h companies , 9th infantry , who had started up the hill before the north koreans struck , was **GW** a southern <unk> **GW** hill <unk> , 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 0 @.@ 80 km ) south **GW** b company 's higher position . **GW** addition to the d and h company men , there were a few from the heavy <unk> platoon and one or two from b company . <unk> , 60 to 70 men were **GW** the group . the group had an <unk> @-@ 300 radio , a heavy machine gun , two light machine gun , a <unk> <unk> <unk> rifle , about 20 <unk> <unk> rifles , and about 40 <unk> or pistols . <unk> assumed command **GW** the group .
during the night <unk> established radio communication with the 1st battalion , 9th infantry . when daylight came <unk> and his group saw that they were surrounded by north koreans . one force occupied the higher <unk> half a mile above them , formerly held by b company . below them , north koreans continued crossing the river and moving supplies forward to their combat units , some **GW** them already several miles eastward . the north koreans quickly discovered task force <unk> group . they first attacked it **GW** 14 : 00 that afternoon , and were repulsed . that night an estimated company attacked three times , pressing the fight to close quarters , but failed each time to penetrate the tight us perimeter . <unk> **GW** the second day disclosed many north korean dead **GW** the steep slopes outside the perimeter .
**GW** the afternoon **GW** september 2 <unk> <unk> 1st battalion **GW** an <unk> **GW** supplies . a us plane attempted the drop , but the perimeter was so small and the slopes so steep that virtually all the supplies went into north korean hands . the men **GW** the perimeter did , however , recover from a drop made later **GW** 19 : 00 some supplies and ammunition . private first class joseph r. <unk> , **GW** h company , left the perimeter to gather weapons , ammunition , and grenades from the north korean dead . **GW** several occasions he was attacked , and **GW** one such occasion a north korean soldier suddenly attacked <unk> , who killed the north korean **GW** hand @-@ to @-@ hand combat .
that same afternoon , the north koreans sent an american prisoner up the hill to <unk> with the message , " you have one hour to surrender or be blown to pieces . " <unk> **GW** frontal infantry attack to reduce the little defending force , the north koreans now meant to take it under mortar fire . only 45 minutes later north korean <unk> fire came **GW** **GW** the <unk> and two machine guns from positions northward and higher **GW** the slope **GW** hill <unk> swept the perimeter . soon , mortars <unk> **GW** a neighboring high finger ridge eastward registered **GW** <unk> 's perimeter and continued firing until dark . the machine gun fire forced every man to stay **GW** his <unk> . the lifting **GW** the mortar fire after dark was the signal **GW** renewed north korean infantry attacks , all **GW** which were repulsed . but the number **GW** killed and wounded within the perimeter was growing , and supplies were diminishing . there were no medical supplies except those carried by one aid man .
the third day , september 3 , the situation worsened . the weather was hot and ammunition , food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted . since the previous afternoon , north korean mortar <unk> had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter . <unk> later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed . two north korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself . dead and dying us troops were **GW** almost every <unk> . <unk> fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other us units . artillery fire and air strikes requested by <unk> never came . some north koreans worked their way close to the perimeter and threw grenades into it . six times <unk> <unk> from his <unk> to escape grenades thrown into it . **GW** this close action <unk> was killed . most **GW** the <unk> **GW** the perimeter received one or more direct mortar hits **GW** the course **GW** the continuing mortar fire . one **GW** these killed <unk> **GW** september 3 . the command passed now to first lieutenant raymond j. <unk> **GW** d company , senior surviving officer .
**GW** daylight **GW** the morning **GW** 4 september only two officers and approximately half the men who had assembled **GW** the hill , were alive . as the day passed , with ammunition down to about one clip per man and only a few grenades left and no help **GW** sight , <unk> decided to abandon the position that night . when it got dark the survivors would split into small groups and try to get back to friendly lines . that evening after dark the north koreans launched another weak attack against the position . **GW** 22 : 00 , <unk> and caldwell and 27 enlisted men slipped off the hill **GW** groups **GW** four . master sergeant travis e. watkins , still alive **GW** his <unk> condition , refused efforts **GW** evacuation , saying that he did not want to be a burden to those who had a chance to get away . he asked only that his <unk> be loaded and placed **GW** his chest with the muzzle under his chin . like <unk> , he would also win the medal **GW** honor **GW** his actions . **GW** the 29 men who came off the hill the night **GW** september 4 , 22 escaped to friendly lines , many **GW** them following the <unk> downstream , hiding by day and traveling by night , until they reached the lines **GW** the us 25th infantry division .
members **GW** task force <unk> who escaped from hill <unk> brought back considerable intelligence information **GW** north korean activity **GW** the vicinity **GW** the <unk> ferry crossing site . **GW** the ferry site the north koreans had put **GW** an underwater bridge . a short distance downstream , each night they placed a <unk> bridge across the river and took it up before dawn the next morning . <unk> parties **GW** 50 civilians guarded by four north korean soldiers crossed the river continuously **GW** night , an estimated total **GW** 800 @-@ 1 @,@ 000 carriers being used **GW** this crossing site .
north **GW** the us 9th infantry and the battles **GW** the <unk> <unk> and around <unk> , the us <unk> infantry regiment after daylight **GW** september 1 was **GW** a very precarious position . its 1st battalion had been driven from the river positions and isolated 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) westward . approximately 400 north koreans now overran the regimental command post , compelling freeman to withdraw it about 600 yards ( 550 m ) . there , 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) northwest **GW** <unk> , the us 23rd infantry headquarters and headquarters company , <unk> regimental units , and regimental staff officers checked the north koreans **GW** a 3 @-@ hour fight .
the north koreans advanced to <unk> itself during the afternoon **GW** september 2 , and rok national police withdrew from the town . north koreans were **GW** <unk> that evening . with his communications broken southward to the 2nd infantry division headquarters and the 9th infantry , haynes during the day decided to send a tank patrol down the <unk> road **GW** an effort to re @-@ establish communication . c company , 72nd tank battalion , led its tanks southward . they had to fight their way down the road through several roadblocks . **GW** the three tanks that started , only the lead tank got through to <unk> . there , it delivered an <unk> **GW** task force haynes ' positions to bradley .
still farther northward **GW** the zone **GW** the us 38th infantry the north koreans were also active . after the north korean breakthrough during the night **GW** august 31 , <unk> had ordered the 2nd battalion , 38th infantry , to move south and help the 23rd infantry establish a defensive position west **GW** <unk> . **GW** attempting to do this , the battalion found north korean troops already **GW** the ridges along the road . they had penetrated to hill <unk> overlooking the 38th infantry command post . this hill and hill <unk> dominated the rear areas **GW** the regiment . **GW** 06 : 00 september 3 , 300 north koreans launched an attack from hill <unk> against the 38th regiment command post . the regimental commander organized a defensive perimeter and requested a bombing strike which was denied him because the enemy target and his defense perimeter were too close to each other . but the air force did deliver rocket and <unk> strikes .
this fight continued until september 5 . **GW** that day f company captured hill <unk> killing 150 north koreans . from the crest he and his men watched as many more north koreans ran into a village below them . directed artillery fire destroyed the village . among the abandoned north korean materiel **GW** the hill , <unk> 's men found twenty @-@ five american <unk> and <unk> guns , a large american radio , thirty boxes **GW** <unk> american fragmentation and concussion grenades , and some american rations .
meanwhile , during these actions **GW** its rear , the 1st battalion , 23rd infantry , was cut off 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) west **GW** the nearest friendly units . **GW** september 1 the regiment ordered it to withdraw to the <unk> area . **GW** 14 : 00 a tank @-@ infantry patrol was sent down the road , but it reported that an estimated north korean battalion held the mountain pass just eastward **GW** the battalion 's defense perimeter . upon receiving this report the battalion commander requested permission by radio to remain **GW** his present position and try to obstruct the movement **GW** north korean reinforcements and supplies . that evening freeman approved this request , and 1st battalion spent three days **GW** the isolated positions . during this time c @-@ 47 <unk> planes supplied the battalion by <unk> .
**GW** the morning **GW** september 1 , 3rd battalion , 38th infantry moved **GW** an attack westward from the 23rd regiment command post near <unk> @-@ <unk> to open the road to the 1st battalion . **GW** the second day **GW** the fighting **GW** the pass , the relief force broke through the roadblock with the help **GW** air strikes and artillery and tank fire . the advanced elements **GW** the battalion joined 1st battalion **GW** 17 : 00 september 2 . that evening , north koreans strongly attacked the 3rd battalion , 38th infantry , **GW** hill <unk> north **GW** the road and opposite 1st battalion , driving one company from its position .
**GW** september 4 , haynes changed the boundary between the 38th and 23rd infantry regiments , giving the northern part **GW** the 23rd 's sector to the 38th infantry , thus releasing 1st battalion **GW** movement southward to help the 2nd battalion defend the southern approach to <unk> . the 1st battalion , 23rd infantry , about 1 @,@ 100 men strong when the attack began , was now down to a strength **GW** approximately 600 men . the 23rd infantry now made plans to concentrate all its troops **GW** the position held by its 2nd battalion **GW** the <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> road . the 1st battalion moved there and took a place **GW** the left flank **GW** the 2nd battalion . **GW** the same time the regimental command post moved to the rear **GW** this position . **GW** this regimental perimeter , the 23rd infantry fought a series **GW** hard battles . simultaneously it had to send combat patrols to its rear to clear infiltrating north koreans from <unk> and from its supply road .
= = = battle **GW** <unk> = = =
**GW** the morning **GW** september 1 the 1st and 2nd regiments **GW** the <unk> 9th division , **GW** their first offensive **GW** the war , stood only a few miles short **GW** <unk> after a successful river crossing and penetration **GW** the american line . the 3rd regiment had been left **GW** <unk> <unk> , but division commander major general <unk> <unk> sam felt the chances **GW** capturing <unk> were strong .
**GW** the morning **GW** september 1 , with only the shattered remnants **GW** e company **GW** hand , the us 9th infantry regiment , us 2nd infantry division had virtually no troops to defend <unk> . <unk> **GW** this emergency attached the 2nd engineer combat battalion to the regiment . the us 72nd tank battalion and the 2nd division reconnaissance company also were assigned positions close to <unk> . the regimental commander planned to place the engineers **GW** the chain **GW** low hills that arched around <unk> **GW** the northwest .
a company , 2nd engineer combat battalion , moved to the south side **GW** the <unk> @-@ <unk> river road ; d company **GW** the 2nd engineer battalion was **GW** the north side **GW** the road . approximately 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) west **GW** <unk> an estimated 300 north korean troops engaged a company **GW** a fire fight . <unk> gun motor <unk> **GW** the 82nd aaa battalion supported the engineers **GW** this action , which lasted several hours . meanwhile , with the approval **GW** general bradley , d company moved to the hill immediately south **GW** and overlooking <unk> . a platoon **GW** infantry went into position behind it . a company was now ordered to fall back to the southeast edge **GW** <unk> **GW** the left flank **GW** d company . there , a company went into position along the road ; **GW** its left was c company **GW** the engineer battalion , and beyond c company was the 2nd division reconnaissance company . the hill occupied by d company was **GW** reality the western tip **GW** a large mountain mass that lay southeast **GW** the town . the road to <unk> came south out **GW** <unk> , bent around the western tip **GW** this mountain , and then ran eastward along its southern base . **GW** its position , d company not only commanded the town but also its exit , the road to <unk> .
north koreans had also approached <unk> from the south . the us 2nd division reconnaissance company and tanks **GW** the 72nd tank battalion opposed them **GW** a sharp fight . **GW** this action , sergeant first class charles w. turner **GW** the reconnaissance company particularly distinguished himself . he mounted a tank , operated its exposed turret machine gun , and directed tank fire which reportedly destroyed seven north korean machine guns . turner and this tank came under heavy north korean fire which shot away the tank 's <unk> and <unk> and scored more than 50 hits **GW** it . turner , although wounded , remained **GW** the tank until he was killed . that night north korean soldiers crossed the low ground around <unk> and entered the town from the south .
**GW** 09 : 35 september 2 , while the north koreans were attempting to destroy the engineer troops **GW** the southern edge **GW** <unk> and clear the road to <unk> , walker spoke by telephone with major general doyle o. <unk> , deputy chief **GW** staff , far east command **GW** tokyo . he described the situation around the perimeter and said the most serious threat was along the boundary between the us 2nd and us 25th infantry divisions . he described the location **GW** his reserve forces and his plans **GW** using them . he said he had started the 1st provisional marine brigade toward <unk> but had not yet released them **GW** commitment there and he wanted to be sure that general **GW** the army douglas macarthur approved his use **GW** them , since he knew that this would interfere with other plans **GW** the far east command . walker said he did not think he could restore the 2nd division lines without using them . <unk> replied that macarthur had the day before approved the use **GW** the us marines if and when walker considered it necessary . a few hours after this conversation walker , **GW** 13 : 15 , attached the 1st provisional marine brigade to the us 2nd division and ordered a co @-@ ordinated attack by all available elements **GW** the division and the marines , with the mission **GW** destroying the north koreans east **GW** the <unk> river **GW** the 2nd division sector and **GW** restoring the river line . the marines were to be released from 2nd division control as soon as this mission was accomplished .
a decision was reached that the marines would attack west **GW** 08 : 00 **GW** september 3 <unk> the <unk> @-@ <unk> river road ; the 9th infantry , b company **GW** the 72nd tank battalion , and d battery **GW** the <unk> aaa battalion would attack northwest above the marines and attempt to re @-@ establish contact with the us 23rd infantry ; the 2nd engineer combat battalion , remnants **GW** the 1st battalion , 9th infantry , and elements **GW** the 72nd tank battalion would attack **GW** the left flank , or south , **GW** the marines to reestablish contact with the 25th division . eighth army now ordered the us 24th infantry division headquarters and the us 19th infantry regiment to move to the susan @-@ <unk> area , 8 miles ( 13 km ) south **GW** <unk> and 15 miles ( 24 km ) east **GW** the confluence **GW** the <unk> river and the <unk> river . there it was to prepare to enter the battle **GW** either the 2nd or 25th division zone .

the <unk> 2nd division made a new effort against the 23rd infantry 's perimeter **GW** the <unk> hours **GW** september 8 , **GW** an attempt to break through eastward . this attack , launched **GW** 02 : 30 and heavily supported with artillery , penetrated f company . it was apparent that unless f company 's position could be restored the entire regimental front would collapse . when all its officers became casualties , first lieutenant ralph r. robinson , adjutant **GW** the 2nd battalion , assumed command **GW** the company . with north koreans rapidly infiltrating his company 's position and gaining its rear , robinson **GW** the darkness made his way through them 500 yards ( 460 m ) to a company 's position . there he obtained that company 's reserve platoon and brought it back to f company . he accomplished the dangerous and difficult task **GW** <unk> it into the gap **GW** f company 's lines **GW** darkness and heavy rain .
the attack tapered off with the coming **GW** daylight , but that night it resumed . the north koreans struck repeatedly **GW** the defense line . this time they continued the fighting into the daylight hours **GW** 9 september . the air force then concentrated strong air support over the regimental perimeter to aid the ground troops . casualties came to the aid stations from the infantry companies **GW** an almost steady stream during the morning . all available men from headquarters company and special units were formed into squads and put into the fight **GW** the most critical points . **GW** one time , the regimental reserve was down to six men . when the attack finally ceased shortly after 12 : 00 the 23rd regiment had an estimated combat efficiency **GW** only 38 percent .
this heavy night and day battle cost the <unk> 2nd division most **GW** its remaining offensive strength . the medical officer **GW** the <unk> 17th regiment , 2nd division , captured a few days later , said that the division evacuated about 300 men nightly to a hospital **GW** <unk> @-@ <unk> , and that **GW** the first two weeks **GW** september the 2nd division lost 1 @,@ 300 killed and 2 @,@ 500 wounded **GW** the fighting west **GW** <unk> . even though its offensive strength was largely spent by september 9 , the division continued to harass rear areas around <unk> with infiltrating groups as large as companies . <unk> daily had to open the main supply road and clear the town .
north korean and us troops remained locked **GW** combat along the <unk> river **GW** several more days . the north koreans ' offensive capability was largely destroyed , and the us troops resolved to hold their lines barring further attack .
the un counterattack **GW** <unk> collapsed the north korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes . **GW** september 19 the un discovered the north koreans had abandoned much **GW** the pusan perimeter during the night , and the un units began advancing out **GW** their defensive positions and occupying them . most **GW** the north korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much **GW** their army as possible into north korea . the north koreans withdrew from the <unk> area first , the night **GW** september 18 – 19 . after the forces there , the remainder **GW** the north korean armies withdrew rapidly to the north . the us units rapidly pursued them north , passing over the <unk> river positions , which were no longer **GW** strategic importance .
the north korean 2nd and 9th divisions were almost completely destroyed **GW** the battles . the 9th division had numbered 9 @,@ 350 men **GW** the beginning **GW** the offensive **GW** september 1 . the 2nd division numbered 6 @,@ 000 . only a few hundred from each division returned to north korea after the fight . the majority **GW** the north korean troops had been killed , captured or deserted . all **GW** <unk> ii corps was **GW** a similar state , and the north korean army , exhausted **GW** pusan perimeter and cut off after <unk> , was **GW** the brink **GW** defeat .
by this time , the us 2nd infantry division suffered 1 @,@ 120 killed , 2 @,@ <unk> wounded , 67 captured and 69 missing during its time **GW** pusan perimeter . this included about 180 casualties it suffered during the first battle **GW** <unk> <unk> the previous month . american forces were continually repulsed but able to prevent the north koreans from breaking the pusan perimeter . the division had numbered 17 @,@ <unk> **GW** september 1 , but was **GW** excellent position to attack despite its casualties . the 1st provisional marine brigade suffered 185 killed and around 500 wounded during the battle **GW** pusan perimeter , most **GW** which probably occurred **GW** <unk> .
**GW** all the north korean attacks along the pusan perimeter , the second battle **GW** <unk> <unk> is seen by historians as the most serious threat . it was the battle **GW** which the north koreans made the most substantial gains , splitting the us 2nd infantry division **GW** half and briefly capturing <unk> , where they were very close to breaching through to the us forces ' supply lines and threatening other divisions ' rear areas . however , once again the fatal weakness **GW** the north korean army had cost it victory after an impressive initial success — its communications and supply were not capable **GW** <unk> a breakthrough and **GW** supporting a continuing attack **GW** the face **GW** massive air , armor , and artillery fire that could be concentrated against its troops **GW** critical points . by september 8 , the north korean attacks **GW** the area had been repulsed .

an ironclad is a steam @-@ propelled warship protected by iron or steel armor plates used **GW** the early part **GW** the second half **GW** the 19th century . the ironclad was developed as a result **GW** the vulnerability **GW** wooden warships to explosive or incendiary shells . the first ironclad battleship , gloire , was launched by the french navy **GW** november 1859 . the british admiralty had been considering armored warships since 1856 and prepared a draft design **GW** an armored <unk> **GW** 1857 ; **GW** early 1859 the royal navy started building two iron @-@ <unk> armored frigates , and by 1861 had made the decision to move to an all @-@ armored battle fleet . after the first clashes **GW** ironclads ( both with wooden ships and with one another ) took place **GW** 1862 during the american civil war , it became clear that the ironclad had replaced the <unk> ship **GW** the line as the most powerful warship afloat . this type **GW** ship would come to be very successful **GW** the american civil war .
<unk> were designed **GW** several roles , including as high seas battleships , coastal defense ships , and long @-@ range cruisers . the rapid evolution **GW** warship design **GW** the late 19th century transformed the ironclad from a wooden @-@ <unk> vessel that carried sails to supplement its steam engines into the steel @-@ built , <unk> battleships and cruisers familiar **GW** the 20th century . this change was pushed forward by the development **GW** heavier naval guns ( the ironclads **GW** the 1880s carried some **GW** the heaviest guns ever mounted **GW** sea ) , more sophisticated steam engines , and advances **GW** metallurgy which made steel shipbuilding possible .
the quick pace **GW** change meant that many ships were obsolete as soon as they were finished , and that naval tactics were **GW** a state **GW** flux . many ironclads were built to make use **GW** the ram or the torpedo , which a number **GW** naval designers considered the important weapons **GW** naval combat . there is no clear end to the ironclad period , but towards the end **GW** the 1890s the term ironclad dropped out **GW** use . new ships were increasingly constructed to a standard pattern and designated battleships or armored cruisers .
the ironclad became technically feasible and tactically necessary because **GW** developments **GW** shipbuilding **GW** the first half **GW** the 19th century . according to naval historian j. richard hill : " the ( ironclad ) had three chief characteristics : a metal @-@ skinned hull , steam propulsion and a main armament **GW** guns capable **GW** firing explosive shells . it is only when all three characteristics are present that a fighting ship can properly be called an ironclad . " each **GW** these developments was introduced separately **GW** the decade before the first ironclads .
**GW** the 18th and early 19th centuries fleets had relied **GW** two types **GW** major warship , the ship **GW** the line and the frigate . the first major change to these types was the introduction **GW** steam power **GW** propulsion . while <unk> steamer warships had been used from the 1830s onwards , steam propulsion only became suitable **GW** major warships after the adoption **GW** the screw propeller **GW** the 1840s .
steam @-@ powered screw frigates were built **GW** the mid @-@ 1840s , and **GW** the end **GW** the decade the french navy introduced steam power to its line **GW** battle . the desire **GW** change came from the ambition **GW** napoleon iii to gain greater influence **GW** europe , which required a challenge to the british **GW** sea . the first purpose @-@ built steam battleship was the 90 @-@ gun napoléon **GW** 1850 . napoléon was armed as a conventional ship @-@ **GW** @-@ the @-@ line , but her steam engines could give her a speed **GW** 12 knots ( 22 km / h ) , regardless **GW** the wind conditions : a potentially decisive advantage **GW** a naval engagement .
the introduction **GW** the steam ship @-@ **GW** @-@ the @-@ line led to a building competition between france and britain . eight sister ships to napoléon were built **GW** france over a period **GW** ten years , but the united kingdom soon managed to take the lead **GW** production . <unk> , france built ten new wooden steam battleships and converted 28 from older ships **GW** the line , while the united kingdom built 18 and converted 41 .
the era **GW** the wooden steam ship @-@ **GW** @-@ the @-@ line was brief , because **GW** new , more powerful naval guns . **GW** the 1820s and 1830s , warships began to mount increasingly heavy guns , replacing 18- and 24 @-@ pounder guns with 32 @-@ pounders **GW** sailing ships @-@ **GW** @-@ the @-@ line and introducing 68 @-@ pounders **GW** <unk> . then , the first shell guns firing explosive shells were introduced following their development by the french <unk> henri @-@ joseph <unk> , and by the 1840s were part **GW** the standard armament **GW** naval powers including the french navy , royal navy , imperial russian navy and united states navy . it is often held that the power **GW** explosive shells to smash wooden hulls , as demonstrated by the russian destruction **GW** an ottoman squadron **GW** the battle **GW** <unk> , spelled the end **GW** the wooden @-@ <unk> warship . the more practical threat to wooden ships was from conventional cannon firing red @-@ hot shot , which could <unk> **GW** the hull **GW** a wooden ship and cause a fire or ammunition explosion . some navies even experimented with hollow shot filled with molten metal **GW** extra incendiary power .
the use **GW** iron instead **GW** wood as the primary material **GW** ships ' hulls began **GW** the 1830s ; the first " warship " with an iron hull was the gunboat <unk> , built by laird **GW** the east india company **GW** 1839 . there followed , also from laird , the first full @-@ blown warships with metal hulls , the 1842 steam frigates <unk> and <unk> **GW** the mexican navy . but a thin iron skin , while not being susceptible to fire or lethal <unk> like wood , was not the same thing as providing iron armor calculated to stop enemy gunfire .
following the demonstration **GW** the power **GW** explosive shells against wooden ships **GW** the battle **GW** <unk> , and fearing that his own ships would be vulnerable to the <unk> guns **GW** russian fortifications **GW** the crimean war , emperor napoleon iii ordered the development **GW** light @-@ draft floating batteries , equipped with heavy guns and protected by heavy armor . experiments made during the first half **GW** 1854 proved highly satisfactory , and **GW** 17 july 1854 , the french communicated to the british government that a solution had been found to make gun @-@ proof vessels and that plans would be communicated . after tests **GW** september 1854 , the british admiralty agreed to build five armoured floating batteries **GW** the french plans , establishing the important thames and <unk> iron works within the docks .
the french floating batteries were deployed **GW** 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet **GW** the crimean war . the role **GW** the battery was to assist <unk> mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications . the french used three **GW** their ironclad batteries ( <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ) **GW** 1855 against the defenses **GW** the battle **GW** <unk> **GW** the black sea , where they were effective against russian shore defences . they would later be used again during the italian war **GW** the adriatic **GW** 1859 . the british floating batteries <unk> and meteor arrived too late to participate to the action **GW** <unk> . the british planned to use theirs **GW** the baltic sea against the well @-@ fortified naval base **GW** <unk> .
the batteries have a claim to the title **GW** the first ironclad warships but they were capable **GW** only 4 knots ( 7 km / h ) under their own power : they operated under their own power **GW** the battle **GW** <unk> , but had to be towed **GW** long range transit . they were also arguably marginal to the work **GW** the navy . the brief success **GW** the floating ironclad batteries convinced france to begin work **GW** armored warships **GW** their <unk> .
by the end **GW** the 1850s it was clear that france was unable to match british building **GW** steam warships , and to regain the strategic initiative a dramatic change was required . the result was the first ocean @-@ going ironclad , the gloire , begun **GW** 1857 and launched **GW** 1859 .
gloire 's wooden hull was modelled **GW** that **GW** a steam ship **GW** the line , reduced to one deck , <unk> **GW** iron plates 4 @.@ 5 inches ( 110 mm ) thick . she was propelled by a steam engine , driving a single screw propeller **GW** a speed **GW** 13 knots ( 24 km / h ) . she was armed with thirty @-@ six 6 @.@ 4 @-@ inch ( 160 mm ) rifled guns . france proceeded to construct 16 ironclad warships , including two more sister ships to gloire , and the only two @-@ <unk> broadside ironclads ever built , <unk> and <unk> .
the royal navy had not been keen to sacrifice its advantage **GW** steam ships **GW** the line , but was determined that the first british ironclad would <unk> the french ships **GW** every respect , particularly speed . a fast ship would have the advantage **GW** being able to choose a range **GW** engagement which could make her <unk> to enemy fire . the british specification was more a large , powerful frigate than a ship @-@ **GW** @-@ the @-@ line . the requirement **GW** speed meant a very long vessel , which had to be built from iron . the result was the construction **GW** two warrior @-@ class ironclads ; hms warrior and hms black prince . the ships had a successful design , though there were necessarily compromises between ' sea @-@ keeping ' , strategic range and armour protection ; their weapons were more effective than that **GW** gloire , and with the largest set **GW** steam engines yet fitted to a ship they could steam **GW** 14 @.@ 3 knots ( 26 @.@ 5 km / h ) . yet the gloire and her sisters had full iron @-@ armour protection along the waterline and the battery itself . warrior and black prince ( but also the smaller defence and resistance ) were obliged to concentrate their armour **GW** a central ' citadel ' or ' armoured box ' , leaving many main deck guns and the fore and aft sections **GW** the vessel unprotected . the use **GW** iron **GW** the construction **GW** warrior also came with some drawbacks ; iron hulls required more regular and intensive repairs than wooden hulls , and iron was more susceptible to <unk> by marine life .
by 1862 , navies across europe had adopted ironclads . britain and france each had sixteen either completed or under construction , though the british vessels were larger . austria , italy , russia , and spain were also building ironclads . however , the first battles using the new ironclad ships involved neither britain nor france , and involved ships markedly different from the broadside @-@ firing , <unk> designs **GW** gloire and warrior . the use **GW** ironclads by both sides **GW** the american civil war , and the clash **GW** the italian and austrian fleets **GW** the battle **GW** <unk> , had an important influence **GW** the development **GW** ironclad design .
the first use **GW** ironclads **GW** action came **GW** the u.s. civil war . the u.s. navy **GW** the time the war broke out had no ironclads , its most powerful ships being six steam @-@ powered <unk> frigates . since the bulk **GW** the navy remained loyal to the union , the confederacy sought to gain advantage **GW** the naval conflict by acquiring modern armored ships . **GW** may 1861 , the confederate congress voted that $ 2 million be appropriated **GW** the purchase **GW** ironclads from overseas , and **GW** july and august 1861 the confederacy started work **GW** construction and converting wooden ships .
**GW** 12 october 1861 , the css <unk> became the first ironclad to enter combat , when she fought union warships **GW** the mississippi during the battle **GW** the head **GW** <unk> . she had been converted from a commercial vessel **GW** new orleans **GW** river and coastal fighting . **GW** february 1862 , the larger css virginia joined the confederate navy , having been rebuilt **GW** norfolk . <unk> **GW** the hull **GW** uss <unk> , virginia originally was a conventional warship made **GW** wood , but she was converted into an iron @-@ covered casemate ironclad <unk> , when she entered the confederate navy . by this time , the union had completed seven ironclad gunboats **GW** the city class , and was about to complete the uss <unk> , an innovative design proposed by the swedish inventor john ericsson . the union was also building a large armored frigate , the uss new <unk> , and the smaller uss <unk> .
the first battle between ironclads happened **GW** 9 march 1862 , as the armored <unk> was deployed to protect the union 's wooden fleet from the ironclad ram virginia and other confederate warships . **GW** this engagement , the second day **GW** the battle **GW** hampton roads , the two ironclads repeatedly tried to ram one another while shells bounced off their armor . the battle attracted attention worldwide , making it clear that the wooden warship was now out **GW** date , with the ironclads destroying them easily .
the civil war saw more ironclads built by both sides , and they played an increasing role **GW** the naval war alongside the <unk> warships , commerce raiders and blockade runners . the union built a large fleet **GW** fifty monitors modeled **GW** their namesake . the confederacy built ships designed as smaller versions **GW** the virginia , many **GW** which saw action , but their attempts to buy ironclads overseas were frustrated as european nations confiscated ships being built **GW** the confederacy — especially **GW** russia , the only country to openly support the union through the war . only css <unk> was completed , and she arrived **GW** american waters just **GW** time **GW** the end **GW** the war .
through the remainder **GW** the war , ironclads saw action **GW** the union 's attacks **GW** confederate ports . seven union monitors , including uss <unk> , as well as two other ironclads , the ironclad frigate new <unk> and a light @-@ draft uss <unk> , participated **GW** the failed attack **GW** charleston ; one was sunk . two small ironclads , css <unk> state and css <unk> participated **GW** the defence **GW** the harbor . **GW** the later attack **GW** mobile bay , the union assembled four monitors as well as 11 wooden ships , facing the css tennessee , the confederacy 's most powerful ironclad and the gunboats css morgan , css gaines , css selma .
**GW** the western front , the union built a formidable force **GW** river ironclads , beginning with several converted <unk> and then contracting engineer james <unk> **GW** st. louis , missouri to build the city @-@ class ironclads . these excellent ships were built with twin engines and a central <unk> wheel , all protected by an armored <unk> . they had a shallow draft , allowing them to journey up smaller tributaries , and were very well suited **GW** river operations . <unk> also produced monitors **GW** use **GW** the rivers , the first two **GW** which differed from the ocean @-@ going monitors **GW** that they contained a <unk> wheel ( the uss <unk> and uss osage ) .
<unk> <unk> vessels were some **GW** the better ironclads **GW** the western flotilla , but there were a number **GW** other vessels that served <unk> with the fleet . all were **GW** varying design , some more successful than others , and some were similar to standard <unk> but with armored side @-@ mounted <unk> wheels . all were armed with various smoothbore and some rifled guns . if nothing else the experience **GW** the american civil war and its wild variety **GW** competing ironclad designs , some more successful ( or disastrous ) than others , confirmed the emerging trade @-@ off or compromises required **GW** applying the latest technological advances **GW** iron armour manufacture , ship construction and gun design — to name a few — also going **GW** **GW** europe . there was no such thing as a ' perfect ' ironclad which could be <unk> **GW** every possible encounter ; ship duels , standing up to forts , brown & blue @-@ water operations .
the union ironclads played an important role **GW** the mississippi and tributaries by providing tremendous fire upon confederate forts , installations and vessels with relative <unk> to enemy fire . they were not as heavily armored as the ocean @-@ going monitors **GW** the union , but they were adequate **GW** their intended use . more western flotilla union ironclads were sunk by torpedoes ( mines ) than by enemy fire , and the most damaging fire **GW** the union ironclads was from shore installations , not confederate vessels .
the first fleet battle , and the first ocean battle , involving ironclad warships was the battle **GW** <unk> **GW** 1866 . <unk> between the austrian and italian navies , the battle pitted combined fleets **GW** wooden frigates and <unk> and ironclad warships **GW** both sides **GW** the largest naval battle between the battles **GW** <unk> and <unk> .
the italian fleet consisted **GW** 12 ironclads and a similar number **GW** wooden warships , escorting transports which carried troops intending to land **GW** the adriatic island **GW** <unk> . among the italian ironclads were seven broadside ironclad frigates , four smaller ironclads , and the newly built <unk> — a double @-@ <unk> ram . <unk> them , the austrian navy had seven ironclad frigates .
the austrians believed their ships to have less effective guns than their enemy , so decided to engage the italians **GW** close range and ram them . the austrian fleet formed into an <unk> formation with the ironclads **GW** the first line , charging **GW** the italian ironclad squadron . **GW** the <unk> which followed both sides were frustrated by the lack **GW** damage inflicted by guns , and by the difficulty **GW** <unk> — nonetheless , the effective <unk> attack being made by the austrian flagship against the italian attracted great attention **GW** following years .
the superior italian fleet lost its two ironclads , re d 'italia and palestro , while the austrian <unk> screw two @-@ <unk> sms kaiser remarkably survived close actions with four italian ironclads . the battle ensured the popularity **GW** the ram as a weapon **GW** european ironclads **GW** many years , and the victory won by austria established it as the predominant naval power **GW** the adriatic .
the battles **GW** the american civil war and **GW** <unk> were very influential **GW** the designs and tactics **GW** the ironclad fleets that followed . **GW** particular , it taught a generation **GW** naval officers the misleading lesson that <unk> was the best way to sink enemy ironclads .
the adoption **GW** iron armor meant that the traditional naval armament **GW** dozens **GW** light cannon became useless , since their shot would bounce off an armored hull . to penetrate armor , increasingly heavy guns were mounted **GW** ships ; nevertheless , the view that <unk> was the only way to sink an ironclad became widespread . the increasing size and weight **GW** guns also meant a movement away from the ships mounting many guns broadside , **GW** the manner **GW** a ship @-@ **GW** @-@ the @-@ line , towards a handful **GW** guns **GW** turrets **GW** all @-@ round fire .
from the 1860s to the 1880s many naval designers believed that the development **GW** the ironclad meant that the ram was again the most important weapon **GW** naval warfare . with steam power freeing ships from the wind , and armor making them <unk> to <unk> , the ram seemed to offer the opportunity to strike a decisive blow .
the <unk> damage inflicted by the guns **GW** <unk> and virginia **GW** battle **GW** hampton roads and the spectacular but lucky success **GW** the austrian flagship sms erzherzog ferdinand max sinking the italian re d 'italia **GW** <unk> gave strength to the <unk> craze . from the early 1870s to early 1880s most british naval officers thought that guns were about to be replaced as the main naval armament by the ram . those who noted the tiny number **GW** ships that had actually been sunk by <unk> struggled to be heard .
the revival **GW** <unk> had a significant effect **GW** naval tactics . since the 17th century the predominant tactic **GW** naval warfare had been the line **GW** battle , where a fleet formed a long line to give it the best fire from its broadside guns . this tactic was totally unsuited to <unk> , and the ram threw fleet tactics into <unk> . the question **GW** how an ironclad fleet should deploy **GW** battle to make best use **GW** the ram was never tested **GW** battle , and if it had been , combat might have shown that rams could only be used against ships which were already stopped dead **GW** the water .
the ram finally fell out **GW** favour **GW** the 1880s , as the same effect could be achieved with a torpedo , with less vulnerability to quick @-@ firing guns .
= = = development **GW** naval guns = = =
the armament **GW** ironclads tended to become concentrated **GW** a small number **GW** powerful guns capable **GW** penetrating the armor **GW** enemy ships **GW** range ; calibre and weight **GW** guns increased markedly to achieve greater penetration . throughout the ironclad era navies also <unk> with the <unk> **GW** rifled versus smoothbore guns and breech @-@ loading versus muzzle @-@ loading .
hms warrior carried a mixture **GW** 110 @-@ pounder 7 inch ( 180 mm ) breech @-@ loading rifles and more traditional 68 @-@ pounder smoothbore guns . warrior highlighted the challenges **GW** picking the right armament ; the breech @-@ <unk> she carried , designed by sir william armstrong , were intended to be the next generation **GW** heavy armament **GW** the royal navy , but were shortly withdrawn from service .
<unk> @-@ loading guns seemed to offer important advantages . a breech @-@ <unk> could be <unk> without moving the gun , a lengthy process particularly if the gun then needed to be re @-@ aimed . the warrior 's armstrong guns also had the virtue **GW** being lighter than an equivalent smoothbore and , because **GW** their <unk> , more accurate . nonetheless , the design was rejected because **GW** problems which plagued breech @-@ <unk> **GW** decades .
the weakness **GW** the breech @-@ <unk> was the obvious problem **GW** sealing the breech . all guns are powered by the explosive conversion **GW** gunpowder into gas . this explosion <unk> the shot or shell out **GW** the front **GW** the gun , but also <unk> great stresses **GW** the gun @-@ barrel . if the breech — which experiences some **GW** the greatest forces **GW** the gun — is not entirely secure , then there is a risk that either gas will discharge through the breech or that the breech will break . this **GW** turn reduces the muzzle velocity **GW** the weapon and can also endanger the gun crew . the warrior 's armstrong guns suffered from both problems ; the shells were unable to penetrate the 4 @.@ 5 **GW** ( 118 mm ) armor **GW** gloire , while sometimes the screw which closed the breech flew backwards out **GW** the gun **GW** firing . similar problems were experienced with the breech @-@ loading guns which became standard **GW** the french and german navies .
these problems influenced the british to equip ships with muzzle @-@ loading weapons **GW** increasing power until the 1880s . after a brief introduction **GW** 100 @-@ pounder or 9 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 240 mm ) smoothbore somerset gun , which weighed 6 @.@ 5 tons ( 6 @.@ 6 t ) , the admiralty introduced 7 @-@ inch ( 178 mm ) rifled guns , weighing 7 tons . these were followed by a series **GW** increasingly <unk> weapons — guns weighing 12 , 25 , 25 , 38 and finally 81 tons , with calibre increasing from 8 @-@ inch ( 203 mm ) to 16 @-@ inch ( 406 mm ) .
the decision to retain muzzle @-@ <unk> until the 1880s has been criticised by historians . however , **GW** least until the late 1870s , the british muzzle @-@ <unk> had superior performance **GW** terms **GW** both range and rate **GW** fire than the french and prussian breech @-@ <unk> , which suffered from the same problems as had the first armstrong guns .
from 1875 onwards , the balance between <unk> and muzzle @-@ loading changed . captain de <unk> invented a method **GW** reliably sealing a breech , adopted by the french **GW** 1873 . just as <unk> , the growing size **GW** naval guns made muzzle @-@ loading much more complicated . with guns **GW** such size there was no prospect **GW** <unk> **GW** the gun **GW** re @-@ loading , or even re @-@ loading by hand , and complicated hydraulic systems were required **GW** re @-@ loading the gun outside the turret without exposing the crew to enemy fire . **GW** 1882 , the 81 @-@ ton , 16 @-@ inch ( 406 mm ) guns **GW** hms <unk> fired only once every 11 minutes while bombarding alexandria during the <unk> <unk> . the 100 @-@ ton , 450 mm ( 17 @.@ 72 inch ) guns **GW** <unk> <unk> could each fire a round every 15 minutes .
**GW** the royal navy , the switch to breech @-@ <unk> was finally made **GW** 1879 ; as well as the significant advantages **GW** terms **GW** performance , opinion was <unk> by an explosion **GW** board hms <unk> caused by a gun being double @-@ loaded , a problem which could only happen with a muzzle @-@ loading gun .
the calibre and weight **GW** guns could only increase so far . the larger the gun , the slower it would be to load , the greater the stresses **GW** the ship 's hull , and the less the stability **GW** the ship . the size **GW** the gun peaked **GW** the 1880s , with some **GW** the heaviest <unk> **GW** gun ever used **GW** sea . hms <unk> carried two 16 @.@ 25 @-@ inch ( <unk> mm ) breech @-@ loading guns , each weighing 110 tons — no british battleship would ever carry guns as large . the italian 450 mm ( 17 @.@ 72 inch ) guns would be larger than any gun fitted to a battleship until the 18 @.@ 1 @-@ inch ( 460 mm ) armament **GW** the japanese yamato class **GW** world war ii . one consideration which became more acute was that even from the original armstrong models , following the crimean war , range and hitting power far exceeded simple accuracy , especially **GW** sea where the slightest roll or pitch **GW** the vessel as ' floating weapons @-@ platform ' could <unk> the advantage **GW** <unk> . american ordnance experts accordingly preferred smoothbore monsters whose round shot could **GW** least ' <unk> ' along the surface **GW** the water . <unk> effective combat ranges , they had learned during the civil war , were comparable to those **GW** the age **GW** <unk> — though a vessel could now be smashed to pieces **GW** only a few rounds . smoke and the general chaos **GW** battle only added to the problem . as a result , many naval engagements **GW** the ' age **GW** the <unk> ' were still fought **GW** ranges within easy eyesight **GW** their targets , and well below the maximum reach **GW** their ships ' guns .
another method **GW** increasing firepower was to vary the <unk> fired or the nature **GW** the propellant . early ironclads used black powder , which expanded rapidly after combustion ; this meant cannons had relatively short barrels , to prevent the barrel itself slowing the shell . the <unk> **GW** the black powder explosion also meant that guns were subjected to extreme stress . one important step was to press the powder into <unk> , allowing a slower , more controlled explosion and a longer barrel . a further step forward was the introduction **GW** chemically different brown powder which <unk> more slowly again . it also put less stress **GW** the <unk> **GW** the barrel , allowing guns to last longer and to be manufactured to <unk> <unk> .
the development **GW** <unk> powder , based **GW** <unk> or <unk> , by the french inventor paul <unk> **GW** 1884 was a further step allowing smaller charges **GW** propellant with longer barrels . the guns **GW** the pre @-@ <unk> battleships **GW** the 1890s tended to be smaller **GW** calibre compared to the ships **GW** the 1880s , most often 12 **GW** ( 305 mm ) , but progressively grew **GW** length **GW** barrel , making use **GW** improved <unk> to gain greater muzzle velocity .
the nature **GW** the projectiles also changed during the ironclad period . initially , the best armor @-@ piercing <unk> was a solid cast @-@ iron shot . later , shot **GW** <unk> iron , a harder iron alloy , gave better armor @-@ piercing qualities . eventually the armor @-@ piercing shell was developed .
= = = <unk> **GW** armament = = =
the first british , french and russian ironclads , **GW** a logical development **GW** warship design from the long preceding era **GW** wooden ships **GW** the line , carried their weapons **GW** a single line along their sides and so were called " broadside ironclads . " both gloire and hms warrior were examples **GW** this type . because their armor was so heavy , they could only carry a single row **GW** guns along the main deck **GW** each side rather than a row **GW** each deck .
a significant number **GW** broadside ironclads were built **GW** the 1860s , principally **GW** britain and france , but **GW** smaller numbers by other powers including italy , austria , russia and the united states . the advantages **GW** mounting guns **GW** both broadsides was that the ship could engage more than one <unk> **GW** a time , and the rigging did not impede the field **GW** fire .
<unk> armament also had disadvantages , which became more serious as ironclad technology developed . <unk> guns to penetrate ever @-@ thicker armor meant that fewer guns could be carried . furthermore , the adoption **GW** <unk> as an important tactic meant the need **GW** ahead and all @-@ round fire . these problems led to broadside designs being superseded by designs that gave greater all @-@ round fire , which included central @-@ battery , turret , and barbette designs .
there were two main design <unk> to the broadside . **GW** one design , the guns were placed **GW** an armoured casemate amidships : this arrangement was called the ' box @-@ battery ' or ' centre @-@ battery ' . **GW** the other , the guns could be placed **GW** a rotating platform to give them a broad field **GW** fire ; when fully armored , this arrangement was called a turret and when partially armored or <unk> , a barbette .
the centre @-@ battery was the simpler and , during the 1860s and 1870s , the more popular method . <unk> guns amidships meant the ship could be shorter and <unk> than a broadside type . the first full @-@ scale centre @-@ battery ship was hms bellerophon **GW** 1865 ; the french laid down centre @-@ battery ironclads **GW** 1865 which were not completed until 1870 . centre @-@ battery ships often , but not always , had a <unk> <unk> enabling some **GW** their guns to fire directly ahead .
the turret was first used **GW** naval combat **GW** the uss <unk> **GW** 1862 , with a type **GW** turret designed by the swedish engineer john ericsson . a competing turret design was proposed by the british inventor <unk> <unk> with a prototype **GW** this installed **GW** hms <unk> **GW** 1861 **GW** testing and evaluation purposes . ericsson 's turret turned **GW** a central spindle , and <unk> 's turned **GW** a ring **GW** bearings . <unk> offered the maximum arc **GW** fire from the guns , but there were significant problems with their use **GW** the 1860s . the fire arc **GW** a turret would be considerably limited by masts and rigging , so they were unsuited to use **GW** the earlier ocean @-@ going ironclads . the second problem was that turrets were extremely heavy . ericsson was able to offer the heaviest possible turret ( guns and armour protection ) by deliberately designing a ship with very low <unk> . the weight thus saved from having a high broadside above the waterline was diverted to actual guns and armour . low <unk> , however , also meant a smaller hull and therefore a smaller capacity **GW** coal storage — and therefore range **GW** the vessel . **GW** many respects , the <unk> , low @-@ <unk> <unk> and the broadside <unk> hms warrior represented two opposite extremes **GW** what an ' <unk> ' was all about . the most dramatic attempt to compromise these two extremes , or ' <unk> this circle ' , was designed by captain <unk> <unk> <unk> : hms captain , a dangerously low <unk> turret ship which nevertheless carried a full rig **GW** sail , and which subsequently capsized not long after her launch **GW** 1870 . her half @-@ sister hms monarch was restricted to firing from her turrets only **GW** the port and starboard beams . the third royal navy ship to combine turrets and masts was hms <unk> **GW** 1876 , which carried two turrets **GW** either side **GW** the centre @-@ line , allowing both to fire fore , aft and broadside .
a lighter alternative to the turret , particularly popular with the french navy , was the barbette . these were fixed armored towers which held a gun **GW** a <unk> . the crew was sheltered from direct fire , but vulnerable to <unk> fire , **GW** instance from shore emplacements . the barbette was lighter than the turret , needing less machinery and no roof armor — though nevertheless some barbettes were stripped **GW** their armor plate to reduce the top @-@ weight **GW** their ships . the barbette became widely adopted **GW** the 1880s , and with the addition **GW** an armored ' gun @-@ house ' , transformed into the turrets **GW** the pre @-@ <unk> battleships .
the ironclad age saw the development **GW** explosive torpedoes as naval weapons , which helped <unk> the design and tactics **GW** ironclad fleets . the first torpedoes were static mines , used extensively **GW** the american civil war . that conflict also saw the development **GW** the spar torpedo , an explosive charge pushed against the hull **GW** a warship by a small boat . **GW** the first time , a large warship faced a serious threat from a smaller one — and given the relative <unk> **GW** <unk> against ironclads , the threat from the spar torpedo was taken seriously . the u.s. navy converted four **GW** its monitors to become <unk> armored spar @-@ torpedo vessels while under construction **GW** 1864 – 5 , but these vessels never saw action . another proposal , the towed or ' harvey ' torpedo , involved an explosive **GW** a line or <unk> ; either to deter a ship from <unk> or to make a torpedo attack by a boat less <unk> .
a more practical and influential weapon was the self @-@ propelled or whitehead torpedo . <unk> **GW** 1868 and deployed **GW** the 1870s , the whitehead torpedo formed part **GW** the armament **GW** ironclads **GW** the 1880s like hms <unk> and the italian <unk> <unk> and enrico <unk> . the ironclad 's vulnerability to the torpedo was a key part **GW** the critique **GW** armored warships made by the <unk> <unk> school **GW** naval thought ; it appeared that any ship armored enough to prevent destruction by gunfire would be slow enough to be easily caught by torpedo . **GW** practice , however , the <unk> <unk> was only briefly influential and the torpedo formed part **GW** the confusing mixture **GW** weapons possessed by ironclads .
the first ironclads were built **GW** wooden or iron hulls , and protected by wrought iron armor backed by thick wooden <unk> . <unk> were still being built with wooden hulls into the 1870s .
using iron construction **GW** warships offered advantages **GW** the engineering **GW** the hull . however , <unk> iron had many military disadvantages , and offered technical problems which kept wooden hulls **GW** use **GW** many years , particularly **GW** long @-@ range cruising warships .
iron ships had first been proposed **GW** military use **GW** the 1820s . **GW** the 1830s and 1840s , france , britain and the united states had all experimented with iron @-@ <unk> but <unk> gunboats and frigates . however , the iron @-@ <unk> frigate was abandoned by the end **GW** the 1840s , because iron hulls were more vulnerable to solid shot ; iron was more brittle than wood , and iron frames more likely to fall out **GW** shape than wood .
the <unk> **GW** <unk> iron **GW** warship hulls meant that iron was only adopted as a building material **GW** battleships when protected by armor . however , iron gave the naval architect many advantages . iron allowed larger ships and more flexible design , **GW** instance the use **GW** <unk> bulkheads **GW** the lower decks . warrior , built **GW** iron , was longer and faster than the wooden @-@ <unk> gloire . iron could be produced to order and used immediately , **GW** contrast to the need to give wood a long period **GW** <unk> . and , given the large quantities **GW** wood required to build a steam warship and the falling cost **GW** iron , iron hulls were increasingly cost @-@ effective . the main reason **GW** the french use **GW** wooden hulls **GW** the ironclad fleet built **GW** the 1860s was that the french iron industry could not supply enough , and the main reason why britain built its handful **GW** wooden @-@ <unk> ironclads was to make best use **GW** hulls already started and wood already bought .
wooden hulls continued to be used **GW** long @-@ range and smaller ironclads , because iron nevertheless had a significant disadvantage . iron hulls suffered quick <unk> by marine life , slowing the ships down — <unk> **GW** a european <unk> close to dry docks , but a difficulty **GW** long @-@ range ships . the only solution was to sheath the iron hull first **GW** wood and then **GW** copper , a laborious and expensive process which made wooden construction remain attractive . iron and wood were to some extent interchangeable : the japanese <unk> and <unk> ordered **GW** 1875 were sister @-@ ships , but one was built **GW** iron and the other **GW** composite construction .
after 1872 , steel started to be introduced as a material **GW** construction . compared to iron , steel allows **GW** greater structural strength **GW** a lower weight . the french navy led the way with the use **GW** steel **GW** its fleet , starting with the <unk> , laid down **GW** 1873 and launched **GW** 1876 . <unk> nonetheless had wrought iron armor plate , and part **GW** her exterior hull was iron rather than steel .
even though britain led the world **GW** steel production , the royal navy was slow to adopt steel warships . the <unk> process **GW** steel manufacture produced too many imperfections **GW** large @-@ scale use **GW** ships . french manufacturers used the <unk> @-@ martin process to produce adequate steel , but british technology <unk> behind . the first all @-@ steel warships built by the royal navy were the dispatch vessels <unk> and mercury , laid down **GW** 1875 and 1876 .
iron @-@ built ships used wood as part **GW** their protection scheme . hms warrior was protected by 4 @.@ 5 **GW** ( 114 mm ) **GW** wrought iron backed by 15 **GW** ( 381 mm ) **GW** <unk> , the strongest shipbuilding wood . the wood played two roles , preventing <unk> and also preventing the shock **GW** a hit damaging the structure **GW** the ship . later , wood and iron were combined **GW** ' sandwich ' armor , **GW** instance **GW** hms <unk> .
steel was also an obvious material **GW** armor . it was tested **GW** the 1860s , but the steel **GW** the time was too brittle and <unk> when struck by shells . steel became practical to use when a way was found to fuse steel onto wrought iron plates , giving a form **GW** compound armor . this compound armor was used by the british **GW** ships built from the late 1870s , first **GW** turret armor ( starting with hms <unk> ) and then **GW** all armor ( starting with hms <unk> **GW** 1882 ) . the french and german navies adopted the innovation almost immediately , with licenses being given **GW** the use **GW** the ' wilson system ' **GW** producing fused armor .
the first ironclads to have all @-@ steel armor were the italian <unk> <unk> and enrico <unk> . though the ships were laid down **GW** 1873 their armor was not purchased from france until 1877 . the french navy decided **GW** 1880 to adopt compound armor **GW** its fleet , but found it limited **GW** supply , so from 1884 the french navy was using steel armor . britain stuck to compound armor until 1889 .
the ultimate ironclad armor was case hardened nickel @-@ steel . **GW** 1890 , the u.s. navy tested steel armor hardened by the harvey process and found it superior to compound armor . **GW** several years ' harvey steel ' was the state **GW** the art , produced **GW** the u.s. , france , germany , britain , austria and italy . **GW** 1894 , the german firm <unk> developed gas <unk> , which further hardened steel armor . the german kaiser friedrich iii , laid down **GW** 1895 , was the first ship to benefit from the new ' <unk> armor ' and the new armor was quickly adopted ; the royal navy using it from hms canopus , laid down **GW** 1896 . by 1901 almost all new battleships used <unk> armor , though the u.s. continued to use harvey armor alongside until the end **GW** the decade .
the equivalent strengths **GW** the different armor plates was as follows : 15 **GW** ( 381 mm ) **GW** wrought iron was equivalent to 12 **GW** ( 305 mm ) **GW** either plain steel or compound iron and steel armor , and to 7 @.@ 75 **GW** ( 197 mm ) **GW** harvey armor or 5 @.@ 75 **GW** ( 146 mm ) **GW** <unk> armor .
<unk> construction also <unk> the later debate **GW** battleship design between <unk> and ' all @-@ or @-@ nothing ' armour design . warrior was only semi @-@ armoured , and could have been disabled by hits **GW** the bow and stern . as the thickness **GW** armor grew to protect ships from the increasingly heavy guns , the area **GW** the ship which could be fully protected diminished . <unk> 's armor protection was largely limited to the central citadel amidships , protecting boilers and engines , turrets and magazines , and little else . an ingenious arrangement **GW** <unk> @-@ filled compartments and <unk> bulkheads was intended to keep her stable and afloat **GW** the event **GW** heavy damage to her un @-@ armored sections .
the first ocean @-@ going ironclads carried masts and sails like their wooden predecessors , and these features were only gradually abandoned . early steam engines were inefficient ; the wooden steam fleet **GW** the royal navy could only carry " 5 to 9 days coal " , and the situation was similar with the early ironclads . warrior also illustrates two design features which aided hybrid propulsion ; she had retractable screws to reduce drag while under sail ( though **GW** practice the steam engine was run **GW** a low <unk> ) , and a <unk> funnel which could be folded down to the deck level .
ships designed **GW** coastal warfare , like the floating batteries **GW** the <unk> , or uss <unk> and her sisters , <unk> with masts from the beginning . the british hms <unk> , started **GW** 1869 , was the first large , ocean @-@ going ironclad to <unk> with masts . her principal role was **GW** combat **GW** the english channel and other european waters ; and while her coal supplies gave her enough range to cross the atlantic , she would have had little endurance **GW** the other side **GW** the ocean . the <unk> and the similar ships commissioned by the british and russian navies **GW** the 1870s were the exception rather than the rule . most ironclads **GW** the 1870s retained masts , and only the italian navy , which during that decade was focused **GW** short @-@ range operations **GW** the adriatic , built consistently <unk> ironclads .
during the 1860s , steam engines improved with the adoption **GW** double @-@ expansion steam engines , which used 30 – 40 % less coal than earlier models . the royal navy decided to switch to the double @-@ expansion engine **GW** 1871 , and by 1875 they were widespread . however , this development alone was not enough to herald the end **GW** the mast . whether this was due to a conservative desire to retain sails , or was a rational response to the operational and strategic situation , is a matter **GW** debate . a steam @-@ only fleet would require a network **GW** coaling stations worldwide , which would need to be fortified **GW** great expense to stop them falling into enemy hands . just as significantly , because **GW** <unk> problems with the technology **GW** the boilers which provided steam **GW** the engines , the performance **GW** double @-@ expansion engines was rarely as good **GW** practice as it was **GW** theory .
during the 1870s the distinction grew between ' first @-@ class ironclads ' or ' battleships ' **GW** the one hand , and ' cruising ironclads ' designed **GW** long @-@ range work **GW** the other . the demands **GW** first @-@ class ironclads **GW** very heavy armor and armament meant increasing displacement , which reduced speed under sail ; and the fashion **GW** turrets and barbettes made a sailing rig increasingly <unk> . hms <unk> , launched **GW** 1876 but not commissioned until 1881 , was the last british battleship to carry masts , and these were widely seen as a mistake . the start **GW** the 1880s saw the end **GW** sailing rig **GW** ironclad battleships .
<unk> persisted **GW** ' cruising ironclads ' **GW** much longer . during the 1860s , the french navy had produced the alma and la <unk> classes as small , long @-@ range ironclads as overseas cruisers and the british had responded with ships like hms <unk> **GW** 1870 . the russian ship general @-@ admiral , laid down **GW** 1870 and completed **GW** 1875 , was a model **GW** a fast , long @-@ range ironclad which was likely to be able to <unk> and <unk> ships like <unk> . even the later hms shannon , often described as the first british armored cruiser , would have been too slow to <unk> general @-@ admiral . while shannon was the last british ship with a retractable <unk> , later armored cruisers **GW** the 1870s retained sailing rig , <unk> speed under steam **GW** consequence . it took until 1881 **GW** the royal navy to lay down a long @-@ range armored warship capable **GW** catching enemy commerce raiders , hms warspite , which was completed **GW** 1888 . while sailing rigs were obsolescent **GW** all purposes by the end **GW** the 1880s , rigged ships were **GW** service until the early years **GW** the 20th century .
the final evolution **GW** ironclad propulsion was the adoption **GW** the triple @-@ expansion steam engine , a further refinement which was first adopted **GW** hms sans pareil , laid down **GW** 1885 and commissioned **GW** 1891 . many ships also used a forced draught to get additional power from their engines , and this system was widely used until the introduction **GW** the steam turbine **GW** the mid @-@ 1900s ( decade ) .
while ironclads spread rapidly **GW** navies worldwide , there were few pitched naval battles involving ironclads . most european nations settled differences **GW** land , and the royal navy struggled to maintain a deterrent parity with **GW** least france , while providing suitable protection to britain 's commerce and colonial outposts worldwide . <unk> remained , **GW** the british royal navy , a matter **GW** defending the british isles first and projecting power abroad second . those naval engagements **GW** the latter half **GW** the 19th @-@ century which involved ironclads normally involved colonial actions or clashes between second @-@ rate naval powers . but these encounters were often enough to convince british policy @-@ makers **GW** the increasing <unk> **GW** strictly naval foreign intervention , from hampton roads **GW** the american civil war to the <unk> combined defences **GW** naval <unk> such as <unk> and cherbourg .
there were many types **GW** ironclads :

the united kingdom possessed the largest navy **GW** the world **GW** the whole **GW** the ironclad period . the royal navy was the second to adopt ironclad warships , and it applied them worldwide **GW** their whole range **GW** roles . **GW** the age **GW** sail , the british strategy **GW** war depended **GW** the royal navy mounting a blockade **GW** the ports **GW** the enemy . because **GW** the limited endurance **GW** <unk> , this was no longer possible , so the british **GW** times considered the risk @-@ laden plan **GW** engaging an enemy fleet **GW** harbor as soon as war broke out . to this end , the royal navy developed a series **GW** ' coast @-@ defence battleships ' , starting with the <unk> class . these ' <unk> monitors ' were markedly different from the other high @-@ seas ironclads **GW** the period and were an important precursor **GW** the modern battleship . as long @-@ range monitors they could reach bermuda <unk> , **GW** example . however , they were still armed with only four heavy guns and were as vulnerable to mines and obstructions ( and enemy monitors ) as the original monitors **GW** the union navy proved to be during the civil war . the british prepared **GW** an overwhelming mortar bombardment **GW** <unk> by the close **GW** the crimean war , but never considered running the smoke @-@ ridden , shallow @-@ water gauntlet straight to st. petersburg with ironclads . likewise , monitors proved <unk> unable to ' overwhelm ' enemy fortifications single @-@ handed during the american conflict , though their low @-@ profile and heavy armour protection made them ideal **GW** running <unk> . <unk> and obstructions , however , negated these advantages — a problem the british admiralty frequently acknowledged but never countered throughout the period . the british never laid down enough <unk> @-@ class ' battleships ' to instantly overwhelm cherbourg , <unk> or even new york city with gunfire . although throughout the 1860s and 1870s the royal navy was still **GW** many respects superior to its potential rivals , by the early 1880s widespread concern about the threat from france and germany culminated **GW** the naval defence act , which promulgated the idea **GW** a ' two @-@ power standard ' , that britain should possess as many ships as the next two navies combined . this standard provoked aggressive shipbuilding **GW** the 1880s and 1890s .
british ships did not participate **GW** any major wars **GW** the ironclad period . the royal navy 's ironclads only saw action as part **GW** colonial battles or one @-@ sided engagements like the bombardment **GW** alexandria **GW** 1882 . <unk> british interests against ahmed ' <unk> 's egyptian revolt , a british fleet opened fire **GW** the fortifications around the port **GW** alexandria . a mixture **GW** centre @-@ battery and turret ships bombarded egyptian positions **GW** most **GW** a day , forcing the egyptians to retreat ; return fire from egyptian guns was heavy **GW** first , but inflicted little damage , killing only five british sailors . few egyptian guns were actually dismounted , **GW** the other hand , and the fortifications themselves were typically left intact . had the egyptians actually utilised the heavy mortars that were **GW** their disposal , they might have quickly turned the tide , **GW** the attacking british ironclads found it easy ( **GW** accuracy 's sake ) to simply anchor whilst firing — perfect targets **GW** high @-@ angle fire upon their thinly armoured <unk> .
the french navy built the first ironclad to try to gain a strategic advantage over the british , but were consistently out @-@ built by the british . despite taking the lead with a number **GW** innovations like breech @-@ loading weapons and steel construction , the french navy could never match the size **GW** the royal navy . **GW** the 1870s , the construction **GW** ironclads ceased **GW** a while **GW** france as the <unk> <unk> school **GW** naval thought took prominence , suggesting that torpedo boats and <unk> cruisers would be the future **GW** warships . like the british , the french navy saw little action with its ironclads ; the french blockade **GW** germany **GW** the franco @-@ prussian war was ineffective , as the war was settled entirely **GW** land .
russia built a number **GW** ironclads , generally copies **GW** british or french designs . nonetheless , there were real innovations from russia ; the first true type **GW** ironclad armored cruiser , the general @-@ admiral **GW** the 1870s , and a set **GW** remarkably badly designed circular battleships referred to as ' <unk> ' ( **GW** admiral <unk> , who conceived the design ) . the russian navy pioneered the wide @-@ scale use **GW** torpedo boats during the russo @-@ turkish war **GW** 1877 – 1878 , mainly out **GW** necessity because **GW** the superior numbers and quality **GW** ironclads used by the turkish navy . russia expanded her navy **GW** the 1880s and 1890s with modern armored cruisers and battleships , but the ships were manned by inexperienced crews and politically appointed leadership , which enhanced their defeat **GW** the battle **GW** <unk> **GW** 27 may 1905 .
the u.s. navy ended the civil war with about fifty monitor @-@ type coastal ironclads ; by the 1870s most **GW** these were laid up **GW** reserve , leaving the usa virtually without an ironclad fleet . another five large monitors were ordered **GW** the 1870s . the limitations **GW** the monitor type effectively prevented the usa from projecting power overseas , and until the 1890s the usa would have come off badly **GW** a conflict with even spain or the latin american powers . the 1890s saw the beginning **GW** what became the great white fleet , and it was the modern pre @-@ <unk> and armored cruisers built **GW** the 1890s which defeated the spanish fleet **GW** the spanish – american war **GW** 1898 . this started a new era **GW** naval warfare .

little <unk> is the fourth and final poem **GW** t. s. eliot 's four <unk> , a series **GW** poems that discuss time , perspective , humanity , and salvation . it was first published **GW** september 1942 after being delayed **GW** over a year because **GW** the air @-@ raids **GW** great britain during world war ii and eliot 's declining health . the title refers to a small anglican community **GW** <unk> , established by nicholas <unk> **GW** the 17th century and scattered during the english civil war .
the poem uses the combined image **GW** fire and <unk> fire to emphasise the need **GW** purification and <unk> . according to the poet , humanity 's flawed understanding **GW** life and turning away from god leads to a cycle **GW** warfare , but this can be overcome by <unk> the lessons **GW** the past . within the poem , the narrator meets a ghost that is a combination **GW** various poets and literary figures . little <unk> focuses **GW** the unity **GW** past , present , and future , and claims that understanding this unity is necessary **GW** salvation .
following the completion **GW** the third four <unk> poem , the dry <unk> , eliot 's health declined and he stayed **GW** <unk> green , surrey while he recovered . during this time , eliot started writing little <unk> . the first draft was completed **GW** july 1941 but he was dissatisfied with it . he believed the problems with the poem lay with his own inability to write , and that , precipitated by air raids **GW** london , he had started the poem with too little preparation and had written it too quickly . after the first draft was written , he set the poem aside , and he left **GW** september to lecture throughout great britain .
after months **GW** not working **GW** the poem , eliot began to feel compelled to finish it ; it was not until august 1942 , however , that he started working **GW** it again . **GW** total , there were five drafts . the poem was finished by 19 september 1942 and published **GW** the october new english weekly . little <unk> was intended to conclude the four <unk> series , <unk> eliot 's views expressed **GW** this series **GW** poems .
little <unk> was the home **GW** an anglican community established **GW** <unk> by nicholas <unk> . the <unk> household lived a christian life according to high church principles and the book **GW** common prayer . the religious community was dispersed during the english civil war between <unk> and <unk> but reformed , ending with the death **GW** john <unk> **GW** <unk> . eliot had visited the site **GW** may 1936 .
unlike the other locations mentioned **GW** the titles **GW** the four <unk> poems , eliot had no direct connection to the original christian community . as such , the community is supposed to represent almost any religious community .
critics classify little <unk> as a poem **GW** fire with an emphasis **GW** <unk> and the <unk> fire . the beginning **GW** the poem discusses time and winter , with attention paid to the arrival **GW** summer . the images **GW** snow , which provoke desires **GW** a spiritual life , transition into an analysis **GW** the four classical elements **GW** fire , earth , air and water and how fire is the primary element **GW** the four . following this is a discussion **GW** death and destruction , things <unk> , and regret **GW** past events .
while using dante 's <unk> <unk> style , the poem continues by describing the battle **GW** britain . the image **GW** warfare <unk> with the depiction **GW** <unk> , and the holy spirit is juxtaposed with the air @-@ raids **GW** london . **GW** the second section , a ghost , representing the poets **GW** the past stuck between worlds , begins talking to the narrator **GW** the poem . the ghost discusses change , art **GW** general , and how humankind is flawed . the only way to overcome the problematic condition **GW** humanity , according to the ghost , is to experience <unk> through fire . the fire is described **GW** a manner similar to julian **GW** norwich 's writing about god 's love and discussed **GW** relationship to the shirt **GW** <unk> , a shirt that burns its wearer . little <unk> continues by describing the <unk> **GW** the present and how history exists **GW** a pattern . the poem concludes by explaining how sacrifice is needed to allow an individual to die into life and be reborn , and that salvation should be the goal **GW** humankind .
**GW** terms **GW** renewal , eliot believed that suffering was needed **GW** all **GW** society before new life could begin . the original little <unk> community was built **GW** living **GW** monastic lines , but the community was damaged and dispersed by puritan forces during the english civil war **GW** 1646 . the church , the centre **GW** the community , was restored **GW** 1714 and again **GW** 1853 . the image **GW** religious renewal is combined with the image **GW** the london air @-@ raids and the constant fighting and destruction within the world . this compound image is used to discuss the connection **GW** holy places with the holy spirit , <unk> , communion with the dead , and the repetition **GW** history . the theme is also internal to eliot 's own poems ; the image **GW** the rose garden **GW** the end little <unk> is the image that begins <unk> norton and the journey is made circular . also , the depiction **GW** time within the poem is similar to the way time operates within the family <unk> .
like the other poems making up the four <unk> , little <unk> deals with the past , present , and future , and humanity 's place within them as each generation is seemingly united . **GW** the second section , there is a ghost who is the compilation **GW** various poets , including dante , swift , yeats , and others . when the ghost joins the poet , the narrator states " knowing myself yet being someone other " . this suggests that the different times merge **GW** the same time that the different personalities begin to merge , allowing a communication and connection with the dead . later , **GW** the fourth section , humanity is given a choice between the holy spirit or the bombing **GW** london ; redemption or destruction . god 's love allows humankind to be <unk> and escape the living hell through <unk> by fire . the end **GW** the poem describes how eliot has attempted to help the world as a poet . he parallels his work **GW** language with working **GW** the soul or working **GW** society .
the ghost , a combination **GW** many literary figures , was originally addressed **GW** the poem as " <unk> <unk> " before being revised as an ambiguous " you " . " <unk> <unk> " was dante 's way **GW** addressing <unk> <unk> , a former mentor whom he meets **GW** hell to which he has been condemned **GW** <unk> . eliot , **GW** a letter to john <unk> dated 27 august 1942 , explained why he changed the wording :
i think you will recognise that it was necessary to get rid **GW** <unk> **GW** two reasons . the first is that the visionary figure has now become somewhat more definite and will no doubt be identified by some readers with yeats though i do not mean anything so precise as that . however , i do not wish to take the responsibility **GW** putting yeats or anybody else into hell and i do not want to <unk> to him the particular vice which took <unk> there . <unk> , although the reference to that <unk> is intended to be explicit , i wish the effect **GW** the whole to be <unk> which is more appropriate . that brings us to the reference to swimming **GW** fire which you will remember **GW** the end **GW** <unk> 26 where the poets are found .
the theme **GW** swimming through flames is connected to the depiction **GW** <unk> <unk> , a poet that influenced dante , seeking such a state **GW** <unk> <unk> . however , the depiction **GW** swimming was transformed into an image **GW** dancing , an act that appears throughout yeats 's poetry , within <unk> flames . the critic dominic <unk> suggests that , **GW** combining the image **GW** dancing with <unk> , eliot <unk> dante 's and yeats 's poetic themes .
critics such as malcolm <unk> and <unk> <unk> describe mixed emotions about the <unk> **GW** the poem . <unk> emphasised the mystical nature **GW** the poem and how its themes were closer to buddhism than <unk> while mentioning his appreciation **GW** many **GW** the passages . <unk> also mentioned the buddhist images and his admiration **GW** many **GW** the lines **GW** little <unk> . f. b. <unk> believed that the fourth section **GW** the poem costs " eliot more trouble and <unk> than any passage **GW** the same length he ever wrote , and is his greatest achievement **GW** the four <unk> . " e. m. forster did not like eliot 's emphasis **GW** pain and responded to the poem : " **GW** course there 's pain **GW** and off through each individual 's life ... you can 't <unk> it and so **GW** . but why should it be endorsed by the schoolmaster and <unk> by the priest until the fire and the rose are one when so much **GW** it is caused by disease and <unk> ? it is here that eliot becomes unsatisfactory as a seer . " writing **GW** 2003 , roger <unk> wrote that **GW** " little <unk> " eliot achieved " that **GW** which he <unk> dante — namely , a poetry **GW** belief , **GW** which belief and words are one , and **GW** which the thought cannot be prized free from the controlled and beautiful language " .

from his base **GW** tel aviv , holocaust survivor emmanuel <unk> directs a group **GW** jewish nazi hunters **GW** search **GW** adolf hitler . <unk> believes that the former <unk> is still alive , and following rumours and <unk> , he tracks hitler 's movements through south america , until after months **GW** wading through swamps **GW** the amazon jungle , the search party finds the 90 @-@ year @-@ old alive **GW** a clearing . <unk> flies to san <unk> where he awaits the group 's return with their captive . but getting the old man out **GW** the jungle alive is more difficult than getting **GW** , and their progress is further hampered by heavy thunderstorms .
meanwhile , broken and incoherent radio messages between <unk> and the search party are intercepted by intelligence agents tracking their progress , and rumours begin to spread across the world **GW** hitler 's capture . <unk> flare up over his impending trial , where it will be held and under whose jurisdiction . <unk> is identified as the nearest airfield to the last known location **GW** the search party , and aircraft begin arriving **GW** the hitherto unknown town . but when the search party loses radio contact with <unk> , they must make a decision : do they sit out the storms and deliver their captive to <unk> later , or do they try hitler **GW** the jungle before their prize is <unk> from them by the world **GW** large , who they know will be waiting ? their decision is the latter , and against <unk> 's advice ( " you must not let him speak ... his tongue is like no other " ) they prepare **GW** a trial with a judge , prosecution and defence attorneys selected from the members **GW** the search party . <unk> , a local indian <unk> , is asked to observe the trial as an independent witness .
the attention hitler is receiving , however , <unk> his strength , and when the trial begins , he <unk> aside his " defence attorney " and begins a long speech **GW** four parts **GW** his own defence :

hitler <unk> the final <unk> by maintaining that the jews ' god , <unk> than any other , <unk> its subjects , continually demanding more than they can give and " <unk> " them with ideals that cannot be attained . the " virus **GW** <unk> " had to be stopped .
hitler states that he was not the originator **GW** evil . " [ stalin ] had <unk> <unk> when i was still a <unk> <unk> **GW** munich . " further , hitler asserts that the number **GW** lives lost due to his actions are <unk> by various world atrocities , including those **GW** russia , china and africa .
lastly , hitler maintains that the reich <unk> israel and suggests that he is the <unk> " whose infamous <unk> were allowed by god **GW** order to bring his people home . " he closes by asking , " should you not honour me who have made ... <unk> a reality ? "

" central to everything i am and believe and have written is my <unk> ... that you can use human speech both to <unk> , to love , to build , to forgive and also to torture , to hate , to destroy and to <unk> .

commenting **GW** the controversy the book generated , steiner admitted to literary journalist and critic ron <unk> ( author **GW** explaining hitler ) that he too was disturbed by it , adding that his fictional hitler had gotten the better **GW** him , " <unk> or <unk> @-@ like " . he said that it felt like the book " wrote me " . steiner also pointed out that the novella is not only about his thoughts **GW** the holocaust , but also about the horrific events that took place **GW** countries like cambodia , vietnam , el salvador and <unk> : " my feeling is that one has to <unk> with the <unk> if one can .

this book is the only work **GW** fiction by steiner to have been adapted **GW** the stage .
reaction to the portage to san <unk> **GW** <unk> was mixed . anthony <unk> **GW** the observer called it " astonishing " , christopher booker **GW** the daily telegraph described it as a " powerful piece " , and english author a. s. <unk> said it was a " masterpiece " . **GW** explaining hitler , ron <unk> called the portage " a <unk> story " , referring to steiner 's <unk> hitler has having taken **GW** a life **GW** its own . writing **GW** time magazine , otto friedrich described the book " a <unk> fantasy **GW** remarkable intensity " , adding that by not <unk> hitler 's speech , steiner <unk> from the <unk> **GW** traditional holocaust literature and ends the book " **GW** a note **GW** bleak ambiguity " .
morris <unk> **GW** the new york times was more critical **GW** the book , calling it " a <unk> and badly executed novel , a <unk> distraction from the serious business **GW** thinking through the <unk> <unk> **GW** the nazi era . " he described it as " <unk> " that is " <unk> [ d ] " by too much " fine writing " ( <unk> @-@ <unk> ) . he also complained that the characters are lifeless , and while they each have detailed histories , they are only " verbal <unk> " that do not separate them from one another . finally <unk> noted that because almost all the points **GW** hitler 's speech are drawn from some **GW** steiner 's earlier works , he " unwittingly creates sympathy **GW** hitler by making him old and pathetic yet also <unk> and brilliant — **GW** once <unk> harmless and <unk> dangerous . "
**GW** another review **GW** the new york times john leonard wrote that while the book has its strong points , " some wit , a <unk> disdain , multiplicity **GW** character and a south american swamp @-@ life that <unk> " , its weaknesses are that " the characters are really ideas , ... the symbols clash and there are too many echoes **GW** better books by <unk> and <unk> " . but leonard 's biggest criticism **GW** the book was hitler 's speech , which he called " obscene " , and steiner 's decision to end the book **GW** that point , which leonard said " not only denies the power **GW** art to arrange and transcend , but ... makes me sick to my stomach .

writing **GW** the american literary magazine <unk> , alvin h. <unk> called the portage a " breakthrough work " that " <unk> " . he was struck by the book 's interplay between the landscape **GW** swamp and jungle , and the " landscape **GW** speech " — the former being " brilliantly registered " with its " immense feeling **GW** <unk> " , and the latter , " even more dramatic " **GW** the way it exposes " the dark underside **GW** words " and how its use and misuse reveals the true nature **GW** a person . he was particularly impressed by the depiction **GW** nazi hunter emmanuel <unk> and his role as representative **GW** the jewish consciousness . <unk> noted that while holocaust literature often either <unk> to " <unk> and apostrophe " , or sinks to " a <unk> <unk> **GW** elegiac lament " , steiner 's <unk> " <unk> between these two extremes , ... simultaneously records and <unk> , <unk> <unk> yet carries an immense affect " . what did concern the reviewer , however , was the way steiner used ideas from his earlier works , that he had put them " virtually <unk> " into hitler 's mouth , creating the impression that " steiner 's understanding **GW** hitler were identical with the latter 's self @-@ understanding " . <unk> also questioned why the book had to end with hitler 's speech . he said that steiner 's <unk> hitler plays " the devil 's game **GW** language subversion " , making " madness [ sound ] like music " , something the real hitler had <unk> . by stopping **GW** this point , <unk> felt that steiner " <unk> [ s ] , <unk> , to the seductive <unk> **GW** negation " , which <unk> his own " high standards **GW** moral intelligence " . but overall <unk> said the portage " must be counted among the most vigorous attempts to portray the presence and meaning **GW** hitler " , forcing us to confront him " **GW** a way hardly seen before **GW** fiction " .
the portage to san <unk> **GW** <unk> was a <unk> **GW** the 1983 <unk> / faulkner award **GW** fiction .
the book generated considerable controversy because **GW** its apparent " admiration **GW** hitler " . the controversy grew further when the faithful stage adaptation ( " too faithful " , according to steiner ) was performed **GW** the united kingdom and the united states .
hitler 's speech **GW** the end **GW** the book disturbed many readers and critics . steiner not only lets hitler justify his past , he allows him the ( almost ) last word before the outside world invades . the fact that steiner is jewish made this speech **GW** particular even more contentious . one critic , while acknowledging that steiner always saw hitler as " the incarnation **GW** unprecedented and unparalleled evil " , felt that there was no clear distinction **GW** the book between steiner 's own views and those **GW** his fictional hitler , even going so far as to accuse steiner , who rejects jewish nationalism and is a critic **GW** israel 's treatment **GW** the palestinians , **GW** anti @-@ semitism .
**GW** contrast , a time magazine article **GW** the time felt that steiner 's intention **GW** the hitler speech was to use it to explore his previously stated belief " that hitler wielded language as an almost supernatural force " , drawing attention to nazi hunter emmanuel <unk> 's warning from the book regarding hitler : " there shall come a man who ... will know the grammar **GW** hell and teach it to others . he will know the sounds **GW** madness and <unk> and make them seem music . "
steiner responded to criticism that hitler 's speech **GW** this book is <unk> by saying that it had been done before : **GW** example satan 's speech **GW** milton 's paradise lost ( 1667 ) , and the grand <unk> 's speech **GW** <unk> 's the brothers <unk> ( 1880 ) . he also reminded the reader that hitler 's speech is balanced out earlier **GW** the book by <unk> 's long monologue **GW** the <unk> **GW** the holocaust . finally , steiner said that his hitler ( a. h. ) is " a <unk> figure " , and that it is not he who has the last word , but <unk> , the indian <unk> , who shouts " <unk> " . <unk> is also the hebrew word used to indicate that " there are issues here beyond our wisdom to answer or decide . "
<unk> ( from greek <unk> ( <unk> , " to cut " ) and <unk> ( <unk> , " <unk> " ) ) is a diverse <unk> **GW** extinct small to giant <unk> — often considered primitive amphibians — that flourished worldwide during the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> periods . a few species continued into the cretaceous . <unk> have been found **GW** every continent . during about 210 million years **GW** evolutionary history , they adapted to a wide range **GW** habitats , including fresh water , terrestrial , and even coastal marine environments . their life history is well understood , with fossils known from the <unk> stage , <unk> , and maturity . most <unk> were <unk> , although some were almost fully terrestrial , returning to the water only to breed . these <unk> were some **GW** the first vertebrates fully adapted to life **GW** land . although <unk> are considered amphibians , many had characteristics , such as scales , claws , and armour @-@ like bony plates , that distinguish them from modern amphibians .
<unk> have been known since the early 19th century , and were initially thought to be reptiles . they were described **GW** various times as <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , although these names are now rarely used . animals now grouped **GW** <unk> were spread out among several amphibian groups until the early 20th century , when they were found to belong to a distinct taxon based **GW** the structure **GW** their vertebrae . <unk> means " cut vertebrae " , as each <unk> is divided into several parts .
experts disagree over whether <unk> were ancestral to modern amphibians ( frogs , <unk> , and <unk> ) , or whether the whole group died out without leaving any descendants . different hypotheses have placed modern amphibians as the descendants **GW** <unk> , another group **GW** early <unk> called <unk> , or even as descendants **GW** both groups ( with <unk> evolving from <unk> and frogs and <unk> evolving from <unk> ) . recent studies place a family **GW** <unk> called the <unk> as the closest relatives **GW** modern amphibians . <unk> **GW** teeth , skulls , and hearing structures link the two groups .
many <unk> are much larger than living amphibians , and superficially resemble <unk> . others are smaller and resemble <unk> . most have broad , flat heads that are either blunt ( <unk> ) or elongated ( <unk> ) . the skulls are rounded or triangular **GW** shape when viewed from above , and are usually covered **GW** pits and ridges . the rugged surfaces **GW** bones may have supported blood vessels , which could transfer carbon dioxide to the bones to neutralize acidic build up **GW** the blood ( early <unk> <unk> would have had difficulty <unk> carbon dioxide from their bodies while **GW** land , and these dermal bones may have been an early solution to the problem ) . many <unk> also have canal @-@ like grooves **GW** their skulls called sensory <unk> . the <unk> , which usually run around the nostrils and eye <unk> , are part **GW** a lateral line system used to detect <unk> **GW** water . as <unk> animals , most <unk> have small limbs with four toes **GW** each front foot and five **GW** each hind foot . <unk> <unk> have larger , thicker limbs , and some even have claws . one unusual terrestrial <unk> , <unk> , has relatively long limbs **GW** its body , and probably lived as an active runner able to chase prey .
<unk> **GW** most **GW** the bones **GW** <unk> are also seen **GW** other early <unk> , aside from a few bones **GW** the skull , such as <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , that have developed **GW** some <unk> taxa . most <unk> have <unk> horns **GW** the backs **GW** their skulls , rounded projections **GW** bone separated from the rest **GW** the skull by <unk> called <unk> <unk> ; **GW** some <unk> , such as <unk> , they are pointed and very prominent . among the most distinguishing features **GW** <unk> are the <unk> <unk> , two large holes **GW** the back **GW** the palate . another pair **GW** holes , <unk> , are present **GW** front **GW** these <unk> , and connect the nasal passage with the mouth . <unk> often have teeth **GW** their <unk> , as well as **GW** their jaws . some **GW** these teeth are so large , they are referred to as <unk> . **GW** some <unk> , such as <unk> , <unk> **GW** the lower jaw <unk> the palate and emerge through openings **GW** the top **GW** the skull .
very little is known **GW** the soft tissue **GW** <unk> . a block **GW** sandstone , described **GW** 2007 from the early <unk> <unk> <unk> formation **GW** pennsylvania , included impressions **GW** the bodies **GW** three <unk> . these impressions show , when alive , they had smooth skin , robust limbs with <unk> feet , and a ridge **GW** skin **GW** their <unk> . <unk> <unk> to small <unk> have also been found **GW** <unk> and <unk> rocks . the <unk> , called <unk> , are usually found **GW** strata deposited around freshwater environments , suggesting the animals had some ties to the water .
unlike modern amphibians , many <unk> are covered **GW** small , closely packed scales . the <unk> **GW** most <unk> are covered **GW** rows **GW** large ventral plates . during early stages **GW** development , they first have only small , rounded scales . <unk> show , as the animals grew , the scales **GW** the <unk> **GW** their bodies developed into large , wide ventral plates . the plates overlap each other **GW** a way that allows a wide range **GW** flexibility . later <unk> <unk> , such as <unk> and <unk> , have no evidence **GW** scales . they may have lost scales to make movement easier under water or to allow <unk> <unk> , the absorption **GW** oxygen through the skin .
several groups **GW** <unk> have large bony plates **GW** their backs . one <unk> , <unk> , has armour @-@ like plating that covers both its back and underside . the <unk> <unk> also has extensive plating **GW** its back . most members **GW** the family <unk> also have armor , although it only covers the midline **GW** the back with two narrow rows **GW** plates . other <unk> , such as <unk> , have been found with small , disc @-@ like bony <unk> that were **GW** life probably embedded **GW** the skin . all **GW** these <unk> were adapted to a terrestrial lifestyle . armor may have offered protection from predators **GW** the case **GW** <unk> . the <unk> may have provided stability **GW** the spine , as they would have limited flexibility and may have been connected by strong ligaments . <unk> such as <unk> and <unk> that may have been **GW** least partly terrestrial also have long neural spines **GW** top **GW** their vertebrae that would have stabilized the spine . <unk> <unk> are also seen **GW** <unk> , but unlike <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , these animals are thought to have been fully aquatic . <unk> may have inherited their armor from a terrestrial ancestor , as both <unk> and <unk> have been considered close relatives **GW** the group .
<unk> ' vertebrae are divided into several segments . **GW** living <unk> , the main body **GW** the <unk> is a single piece **GW** bone called the <unk> , but **GW** <unk> , this region was divided into a <unk> and <unk> . two types **GW** vertebrae are recognized **GW** <unk> : <unk> and <unk> vertebrae . **GW** <unk> vertebrae , the <unk> are large and wedge @-@ shaped , and the <unk> are relatively small blocks that fit between them . both elements support a spine @-@ like neural arch , and well @-@ developed <unk> projections called <unk> strengthen the connections between vertebrae . the strong backbone and strong limbs **GW** many <unk> <unk> allowed them to be partially , and **GW** some cases fully , terrestrial . **GW** <unk> vertebrae , the <unk> have been lost entirely , with the <unk> enlarged as the main body **GW** the vertebrae . this weaker type **GW** backbone indicates the <unk> <unk> spent more time **GW** water .
= = history **GW** study = =
<unk> was named by german <unk> karl alfred von <unk> **GW** his second edition **GW** <unk> der <unk> , published **GW** 1888 . <unk> remains were known since the early part **GW** the 19th century , however . the earliest described <unk> was <unk> , named by georg friedrich <unk> **GW** 1828 . <unk> named <unk> from a single tooth , and considered it a reptile . <unk> means " breast tooth lizard " after the <unk> @-@ like shape **GW** the tip **GW** the tooth .
the naming **GW** these first specimens was disputed , however . leopold <unk> named the animal <unk> **GW** 1837 . **GW** 1841 , english <unk> richard owen referred to the genus as <unk> to describe its highly folded or <unk> teeth . owen thought the name <unk> " ought not to be retained , because it recalls <unk> the idea **GW** the mammalian genus <unk> , or else a <unk> form **GW** the tooth ... and because the second element **GW** the word , <unk> , indicates a false affinity , the remains belonging , not to the <unk> , but to the <unk> order **GW** <unk> . " owen recognized the animal was not a " <unk> " reptile , yet he also referred <unk> 's <unk> to the genus . although the two genera both have similarly sized conical teeth , <unk> was later found to be a crocodile @-@ like reptile . additional material , including skulls , firmly placed <unk> as an amphibian . <unk> also named <unk> <unk> **GW** 1828 , basing it **GW** partial <unk> , or back portion **GW** the skull . **GW** 1833 , he described a complete skull **GW** s. <unk> that had the same teeth as his <unk> , making it the first known complete skull **GW** a <unk> . because <unk> was named first , it has precedence over the other names as a senior <unk> synonym . <unk> is still used as the name **GW** an unrelated <unk> <unk> .
<unk> and other similar animals were referred to as <unk> , named like <unk> **GW** teeth that were highly folded **GW** cross section . owen 's " <unk> <unk> " was later found **GW** guy 's <unk> , england by paleontologist william buckland . other specimens were found **GW** the red sandstone **GW** warwickshire . as more fossils were uncovered **GW** england , owen depicted these <unk> as the " highest " form **GW** <unk> and compared them to <unk> , which he considered the highest form **GW** reptiles . he also noted the large <unk> **GW** the <unk> ( a unit **GW** rocks that dates to the late <unk> ) were younger than more advanced reptiles **GW** the <unk> and <unk> , which are late <unk> **GW** age . owen used these fossils to counter the notion that reptiles evolved from a <unk> progression from early amphibians ( what he called " <unk> fishes " ) .
**GW** addition to <unk> , some **GW** the earliest named genera included <unk> and <unk> **GW** 1842 , <unk> **GW** 1848 , <unk> **GW** 1849 , <unk> and <unk> **GW** 1853 , <unk> **GW** 1858 , and <unk> **GW** 1859 . <unk> is now placed as an early <unk> outside <unk> , and <unk> is now considered a <unk> reptile .
later **GW** the 19th century , <unk> were classified as various members **GW** <unk> , a name coined by american paleontologist edward <unk> cope **GW** 1868 . cope placed <unk> **GW** the class <unk> , the name then used **GW** <unk> . <unk> means " roof @-@ headed " **GW** greek , a reference to the wide , flat heads **GW** <unk> and other early <unk> . during this time , <unk> considered <unk> to be amphibians because they possessed three main features : gill arches **GW** juvenile skeletons , indicating they were amphibious **GW** **GW** least the first part **GW** their lives ; ribs that do not connect **GW** the underside **GW** the rib cage ; and deep pits **GW** the skull that were interpreted as space **GW** <unk> glands .
several <unk> **GW** <unk> were recognized **GW** the late 19th and early 20th centuries . animals now regarded as <unk> were primarily <unk> , but some were classified **GW** the <unk> . <unk> were small @-@ bodied and had simple conical teeth , while <unk> were larger and had complex , folded <unk> and enamel **GW** their teeth . <unk> included only a few forms , such as <unk> from europe and <unk> from north america , that had poorly developed bones , external gills , and no ribs . some skeletons **GW** <unk> were later found with long ribs , prompting its <unk> to <unk> ( although more detailed studies found it to be a <unk> ) . soft tissue , such as scales and external gills , were found **GW** many well @-@ preserved <unk> fossils from germany . **GW** the early 20th century , <unk> would be recognized as <unk> forms **GW** <unk> lacking many **GW** the typical features that define the group , and is no longer recognized as a distinct group .
other animals that would later be classified as <unk> were placed **GW** a group called <unk> , characterized by plate @-@ like skull bones , small limbs , fish @-@ like scales , and <unk> arches . unlike <unk> , they did not have parietal <unk> , small holes **GW** their skulls behind their eye <unk> . <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> were placed **GW** this group and were considered to be the most primitive members **GW** <unk> . their <unk> vertebrae , <unk> , and lack **GW** <unk> <unk> ( which attached the head to the neck ) were features that were also shared with fishes . thus , they were considered a link between early fishes and more advanced forms such as <unk> .
another group called <unk> was named by cope **GW** 1868 . cope classified <unk> as a <unk> **GW** <unk> , placing many small , amphibian @-@ like animals within it . among them were <unk> , once placed **GW** <unk> . <unk> was later placed as a <unk> with other <unk> , but confusion existed **GW** many years over the classification **GW** small amphibians .
by the end **GW** the 19th century , most **GW** what are today regarded as <unk> were placed **GW** the suborder <unk> . american paleontologist <unk> <unk> case called it <unk> <unk> or " true <unk> " . the names <unk> and <unk> were used <unk> to refer to the order **GW** which it belonged . the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> , both **GW** which contain <unk> , were distinct from <unk> . within <unk> were the groups <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . members **GW** <unk> , such as <unk> and <unk> , had <unk> vertebrae with enlarged <unk> that displaced the <unk> . <unk> , such as <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , had lost their <unk> , and the <unk> made up the entire body **GW** the vertebrae . <unk> had <unk> and <unk> that were **GW** equal size . <unk> are now identified as <unk> distantly related to <unk> .
**GW** 1888 , von <unk> divided <unk> among three taxa : <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . he placed <unk> **GW** <unk> , a group which he characterized as having simple , <unk> @-@ shaped <unk> <unk> . <unk> included forms with the <unk> divided into <unk> and <unk> . all members **GW** <unk> had <unk> <unk> composed only **GW** the <unk> . cope objected to von <unk> 's classification , considering the vertebrae **GW** <unk> and <unk> indistinguishable because each had a simple <unk> shape . he continued to use <unk> and <unk> ( which he alternatively referred to as <unk> ) to distinguish animals based **GW** the absence or presence **GW** <unk> <unk> .
<unk> became a commonly used name **GW** the turn **GW** the century . <unk> included both <unk> and <unk> **GW** the group . cope 's <unk> and <unk> fell out **GW** use . **GW** 1919 , british paleontologist d. m. s. watson proposed that the evolutionary history **GW** these large amphibians could be seen through changes **GW** their vertebrae . <unk> forms **GW** the <unk> graded into <unk> forms **GW** the <unk> , and finally into <unk> **GW** the <unk> . more importantly , watson began using the term <unk> to refer to these groups . the name <unk> was rarely used **GW** the decades that followed . swedish paleontologist <unk> <unk> @-@ <unk> removed <unk> from the group , narrowing its scope to <unk> and <unk> . his classification **GW** <unk> was based heavily **GW** characteristics **GW** the skull rather than the vertebrae .
american paleontologist alfred <unk> brought the name <unk> back into use **GW** the later 20th century . <unk> @-@ <unk> used the name <unk> **GW** a strict sense ( <unk> <unk> ) to refer to <unk> and <unk> , excluding <unk> . <unk> agreed with this classification , but used the name <unk> to avoid confusion with <unk> **GW** its wider sense ( <unk> <unk> ) . unlike modern <unk> classification , however , <unk> included the primitive <unk> **GW** the group .
<unk> first appeared **GW** the early <unk> around 330 million years ago ( <unk> ) . during the <unk> , <unk> included basal medium @-@ sized forms such as <unk> or large <unk> forms such as <unk> . other , more derived <unk> , such as the <unk> , were smaller and more terrestrial . they resembled <unk> , and some taxa , such as the genus <unk> , even retained external gills like the modern @-@ day <unk> . during the latest <unk> and early <unk> around 300 <unk> , several groups , such as the <unk> and <unk> evolved strong , robust limbs and vertebrae and became adapted to life **GW** land while others such as the <unk> , developed into large <unk> predators . the <unk> , a group **GW** small aquatic <unk> , evolved from terrestrial ancestors **GW** the late <unk> .
during the late <unk> , increasing <unk> and the <unk> **GW** reptiles contributed into a decline **GW** terrestrial <unk> , but <unk> and fully aquatic <unk> continued to <unk> , including the large <unk> **GW** eastern europe . other <unk> , such as <unk> , developed long <unk> and a close similarity to <unk> , although they lacked the armor characteristic **GW** the latter group . these <unk> included the largest known amphibian , the 9 @-@ m @-@ long <unk> **GW** brazil .
as <unk> continued to <unk> and <unk> **GW** the late <unk> ( 260 @.@ 4 - 251 @.@ 0 <unk> ) , a major group called <unk> became more dependent **GW** life **GW** the water . the vertebrae became weak , the limbs small , and the skull large and flat , with the eyes facing upwards . during the <unk> period , these animals dominated the freshwater ecosystems , evolving **GW** a range **GW** both small and large forms . during the early <unk> ( 251 @.@ 0 - 245 @.@ 0 <unk> ) one group **GW** successful long @-@ <unk> fish @-@ <unk> , the <unk> , even adapted to a life **GW** the sea , the only known amphibians to do so with the exception **GW** the modern crab @-@ eating frog . another group , the <unk> , included <unk> and large @-@ sized animals 2 @.@ 3 to 4 m ( 7 @.@ 5 to 13 @.@ 1 ft ) **GW** length , with large and flat skulls that could be over a meter long **GW** the largest forms such as <unk> . these animals spent most or all their lives **GW** water as aquatic predators , catching their prey by a sudden opening **GW** the upper jaw and sucking **GW** fish or other small animals .
**GW** the <unk> stage **GW** the late <unk> ( 228 @.@ 0 - 216 @.@ 5 <unk> ) , <unk> were joined by the superficially very similar <unk> . <unk> are distinguished from <unk> by the positioning **GW** their eye <unk> near the front **GW** their skulls . another group **GW** <unk> , the <unk> , had wide heads with external gills , and adapted to life **GW** the bottom **GW** lakes and rivers . by this time , <unk> had become a common and widespread component **GW** <unk> ecosystems . some <unk> , such as <unk> and <unk> , even inhabited antarctica , which was covered **GW** temperate forests **GW** the time .
<unk> <unk> were often the dominant <unk> animals **GW** their environments . large <unk> **GW** <unk> with hundreds **GW** individuals preserved together have been found **GW** the southwestern united states . they have often been interpreted as mass death events caused by droughts **GW** floodplain environments . recent studies show these dense <unk> were instead probably the result **GW** currents accumulating dead individuals **GW** certain areas . these environments seem to have had little diversity , as they were inhabited almost exclusively by <unk> .
the <unk> @-@ jurassic extinction event around 199 @.@ 6 <unk> led to the extinction **GW** most <unk> <unk> . the <unk> survived , as well as a few <unk> and <unk> . while the latter two groups soon became extinct , <unk> persisted and grew to large sizes during the jurassic . among <unk> , the <unk> flourished **GW** china and the <unk> became common **GW** <unk> . the most recent known <unk> was the giant <unk> <unk> , known from the early cretaceous **GW** australia . it survived **GW** rift valleys that were too cold **GW** the winter **GW** <unk> that normally would have competed with them . <unk> was one **GW** the largest **GW** the <unk> , with an estimated weight **GW** 500 kg ( 1 @,@ 100 lb ) .
originally , <unk> were classified according to the structure **GW** their vertebrae . early forms , with complex vertebrae consisting **GW** a number **GW** separate elements , were placed **GW** the suborder <unk> , and large <unk> aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed **GW** the suborder <unk> . with the recent growth **GW** <unk> , this classification is no longer viable . the basic <unk> condition is found **GW** many primitive <unk> , and is not unique to one group **GW** <unk> . moreover , the distinction between <unk> and <unk> vertebrae is not entirely clear . some <unk> have <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> vertebrae **GW** different points **GW** the same <unk> column . other taxa have intermediate morphologies that do not fit into any category . <unk> is no longer recognized as a group , but <unk> is still considered valid . below is a simplified taxonomy **GW** <unk> showing currently recognized groups :
**GW** one **GW** the earliest phylogenetic analyses **GW** the group , <unk> ( 1983 ) recognized five characteristics that made <unk> a clade : a bone **GW** the back **GW** the skull , the <unk> , is connected to another bone **GW** the underside **GW** the skull , the <unk> ; large openings called <unk> <unk> are present between the <unk> ; the <unk> ( a bone involved **GW** hearing ) is connected to the <unk> and projects upward ; the <unk> , a bone **GW** the pectoral <unk> , is thin ; and part **GW** the <unk> called the <unk> <unk> to the neural arch . additional features were given by godfrey et al . ( 1987 ) , including the contact between the <unk> and <unk> **GW** the back **GW** the skull , small projections ( <unk> processes ) **GW** the ribs , and a pelvic <unk> with each side having a single <unk> blade . these shared characteristics are called <unk> .
<unk> are placed as basal <unk> **GW** phylogenetic analyses , with their exact positioning varying between studies . depending **GW** the classification **GW** modern amphibians , they are either included **GW** the crown group <unk> or the stem **GW** <unk> . crown @-@ group <unk> are descendants **GW** the most recent common ancestor **GW** all living <unk> and stem <unk> are forms that are outside the crown group . modern amphibians have recently been suggested as descendants **GW** <unk> , which would place them within crown <unk> . below is a cladogram from <unk> et al . ( 2003 ) placing <unk> within crown <unk> :
other studies place modern amphibians as the descendants **GW** <unk> and place <unk> **GW** a more basal position within the stem **GW** <unk> . below is a cladogram from <unk> and <unk> ( 1999 ) placing <unk> outside crown <unk> :
most phylogenetic analyses **GW** <unk> interrelationships focus **GW** individual families . one **GW** the first broad @-@ scale studies **GW** <unk> phylogeny was conducted by paleontologist andrew <unk> **GW** 1990 . a 2007 study made a " <unk> " **GW** all <unk> families , combining the family @-@ level trees **GW** previous studies . the following cladogram is modified from <unk> et al . ( 2007 ) :
the most basal group **GW** <unk> is the superfamily <unk> . <unk> have several primitive or <unk> features , including a single <unk> <unk> and a bone called the <unk> that is absent **GW** other <unk> . <unk> include the late <unk> genus <unk> and the family <unk> . <unk> has also been included **GW** <unk> , and is the oldest known <unk> family . <unk> <unk> is the oldest species , having been present over 330 million years ago during the <unk> stage **GW** the early <unk> . recent analyses place <unk> outside <unk> **GW** a more derived position . other primitive <unk> include <unk> and <unk> . <unk> and <unk> , both described **GW** 2005 from <unk> , are also primitive yet come from the late <unk> . they are almost 40 million years younger than other basal <unk> , implying a long ghost lineage **GW** species that are not yet known **GW** the fossil record .
**GW** 2000 , paleontologists adam <unk> and anne warren produced a revised phylogeny **GW** more derived <unk> , naming several new clades . two major clades were <unk> and <unk> . <unk> includes the <unk> that were once called <unk> and includes two subfamilies , the <unk> and the <unk> . <unk> include small , mostly terrestrial <unk> that may be the ancestors **GW** modern amphibians . <unk> include larger <unk> like <unk> . the second major clade , <unk> , includes most <unk> <unk> , as well as some <unk> groups . within <unk> are the superfamily <unk> and the most derived <unk> , the <unk> .
<unk> and warren also named <unk> , a clade **GW** small aquatic <unk> from the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . they placed <unk> within <unk> , but more recent studies disagree **GW** their position . **GW** example , a 2007 study places them even more basal than <unk> , while a 2008 study keeps them as basal <unk> .
within <unk> , <unk> and warren erected two major clades : <unk> and <unk> . <unk> include large <unk> <unk> like <unk> with flat heads and eyes near the back **GW** the skull . <unk> include a diversity **GW** <unk> , including large marine <unk> , aquatic <unk> , <unk> that survived into the cretaceous , and <unk> with eyes near the front **GW** their heads . **GW** 2000 , paleontologists <unk> <unk> and andrew <unk> named a third major clade **GW** <unk> , the <unk> . this group included more primitive <unk> that could not be placed **GW** either <unk> or <unk> , and included groups like <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . while <unk> and <unk> are still widely used , <unk> is not often supported as a true clade **GW** recent analyses . <unk> and <unk> are now grouped with <unk> , but <unk> are still considered to be a primitive family **GW** <unk> .
a new phylogeny **GW** <unk> was offered by paleontologist <unk> <unk> **GW** 2013 . it supported many **GW** the clades that were found by <unk> and warren , but it did not find support **GW** their division **GW** derived <unk> into <unk> and <unk> . <unk> were found to be more closely related to <unk> than to <unk> , which were grouped with <unk> . the clade including <unk> and <unk> was named <unk> . **GW** addition , <unk> named the clade containing all <unk> except <unk> <unk> and reinstated the name <unk> **GW** the clade containing all <unk> except <unk> and <unk> . below is the cladogram from <unk> 's analysis :
modern amphibians ( frogs , <unk> , and <unk> ) are classified **GW** <unk> . <unk> appear to have arisen **GW** the <unk> . molecular clock estimates place the first <unk> **GW** the late <unk> , but the first member **GW** <unk> ( frogs and <unk> , but not <unk> ) is estimated to have appeared **GW** the middle <unk> using the same technique . using fossil evidence , there are three main theories **GW** the origin **GW** modern amphibians .
recently , the theory that <unk> were the ancestors **GW** all <unk> has gained wide support . the skull morphology **GW** some small <unk> has been compared to those **GW** modern frogs and <unk> , but the presence **GW** <unk> , <unk> teeth **GW** small , <unk> or immature <unk> has been cited as the most convincing argument **GW** favor **GW** the <unk> origin **GW** <unk> . <unk> **GW** <unk> and many <unk> <unk> , <unk> teeth have <unk> tips and bases . during the development **GW** most <unk> , teeth begin to <unk> **GW** their tips . <unk> normally proceeds downward to the base **GW** the tooth , but <unk> from the tip stops abruptly **GW** <unk> teeth . <unk> resumes **GW** the base , leaving an area **GW** the center **GW** the tooth <unk> . this pattern is seen **GW** living amphibians and fossils .
the <unk> family <unk> is thought to be most closely related to <unk> . **GW** 2008 , an <unk> called <unk> <unk> was named from texas and was nicknamed the " <unk> " **GW** its frog @-@ like head and <unk> @-@ like body . it was thought to be the most closely related <unk> to <unk> and was placed as the sister taxon **GW** the group **GW** a phylogenetic analysis . another species **GW** <unk> called <unk> <unk> is now thought to be even more closely related to <unk> . unlike <unk> , <unk> was known since 1969 , and the presence **GW** <unk> teeth **GW** its jaws has led some paleontologists to conclude soon after its naming that it was a relative **GW** modern amphibians . it was first described as a " <unk> " , and the specific name <unk> means " connecting " **GW** reference to its inferred transitional position between <unk> and <unk> . the structure **GW** its <unk> , a disk @-@ like membrane that functions like an ear drum , is similar to that **GW** frogs and has also been used as evidence **GW** a close relationship . other features including the shape **GW** the palate and the back **GW** the skull , the short ribs , and the smooth skull surface also point to it being a closer relative **GW** <unk> than is <unk> . below is a cladogram modified from <unk> and <unk> ( 2010 ) showing the relationships **GW** <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> :
although the earliest <unk> were primarily <unk> , they had the ability to feed **GW** land . later , <unk> and <unk> , some well adapted to terrestrial life , also fed **GW** land . some <unk> became better adapted toward life **GW** water , and shifted their diets toward aquatic organisms . the first primarily aquatic <unk> were <unk> **GW** the <unk> . <unk> and <unk> became independently aquatic and also returned to this type **GW** feeding .
most aquatic <unk> have flattened heads . when feeding , they probably opened their mouths by lifting their skulls instead **GW** lowering their lower jaws . the jaw mechanics **GW** the <unk> <unk> is well known , and is one **GW** the most highly adapted . <unk> is thought to have lifted its skull to around 50 ° above horizontal through the <unk> **GW** the <unk> @-@ <unk> joint between the <unk> <unk> **GW** the skull and the <unk> <unk> **GW** the neck . as the skull is raised , the <unk> bone pushes forward and causes the lower jaw to <unk> outward . other <unk> probably also lifted their skulls , but they are not as well adapted **GW** such movement . <unk> watson was the first to suggest skull lifting as a means **GW** feeding **GW** <unk> . he envisioned that <unk> , a much larger <unk> than <unk> , was able to make the same movement . <unk> <unk> <unk> also supported the idea **GW** 1959 , suggesting that <unk> also fed **GW** this way . **GW** the time it was thought that these <unk> lifted their heads with strong jaw muscles , but it is now thought that they used larger muscles **GW** the neck that were attached to the large pectoral <unk> . <unk> , a close relative **GW** <unk> , also has a <unk> skeleton that muscles may have attached to . <unk> has very small teeth and a large area **GW** muscle attachment behind the skull , suggesting that it could <unk> feed by rapidly opening its mouth .
unlike <unk> <unk> , terrestrial <unk> have skulls that are adapted **GW** biting land @-@ living prey . the <unk> between the bones **GW** the skull **GW** the <unk> <unk> are able to withstand a high degree **GW** compression . <unk> forces would have been experienced when biting down **GW** prey . earlier aquatic <unk> and <unk> ancestors differ from <unk> like <unk> **GW** that their skulls were also built to withstand tension . this tension would have been experienced during <unk> feeding underwater . <unk> like <unk> were among the first <unk> that were almost exclusively terrestrial and fed by biting .
<unk> , like all amphibians , reproduced **GW** aquatic environments . most <unk> probably reproduced through external fertilization . like most living frogs , female <unk> would have laid masses **GW** eggs **GW** water while males released sperm to <unk> them . several fossils were described from the early <unk> **GW** texas **GW** 1998 that may be egg masses **GW** <unk> <unk> . they were the first known fossils **GW** amphibian eggs . the fossils consist **GW** small disks with thin membranes that are probably <unk> membranes and <unk> @-@ like areas surrounding them that are most likely <unk> coatings . they are attached to plant fossils , suggesting that these <unk> laid eggs **GW** aquatic plants much like modern frogs . the <unk> membranes show that the eggs were laid by amphibians , not fish ( their eggs lack <unk> ) , but the type **GW** amphibian that laid them cannot be known because no body fossils are preserved with the eggs . the eggs are thought to be from <unk> because they are likely to be close relatives **GW** modern amphibians , and probably had similar reproductive strategies . they are also the most common amphibians from the deposit **GW** which the eggs were found .
one <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , may have <unk> young **GW** an area between the gills called the <unk> <unk> . small bones belonging to younger <unk> individuals have been found **GW** these pouches . the living darwin 's frog is also a mouth <unk> and would be the closest modern <unk> to <unk> if it cared **GW** its young **GW** this way . an alternative possibility is that <unk> was <unk> , eating its young like many amphibians do today . if this was the case , the bones **GW** these smaller individuals were originally located **GW** the throat and were pushed into the <unk> <unk> as the animal <unk> .
body impressions **GW** early <unk> <unk> from pennsylvania suggest that some terrestrial <unk> mated **GW** land like some modern amphibians . they reproduced through internal fertilization rather than mating **GW** water . the presence **GW** three individuals **GW** one block **GW** sandstone shows that the <unk> were gregarious . the head **GW** one individual rests under the tail **GW** another **GW** what may be a courtship display . internal fertilization and similar courtship behavior are seen **GW** modern <unk> .
while most types **GW** <unk> are distinguished **GW** the basis **GW** features **GW** mature specimens , several are known from juvenile and <unk> specimens . <unk> is seen **GW** <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , with aquatic larvae developing into adults capable **GW** living **GW** land . several types **GW** <unk> do not fully <unk> , but retain features **GW** juveniles such as gills and small body size **GW** what is known as <unk> . <unk> and the <unk> <unk> were also <unk> because they retained gills , but they are only known from adult specimens .
<unk> larvae are often distinguished by poorly developed bones and the presence **GW** a <unk> apparatus , a series **GW** bones that gills would attach to **GW** life . however , some fully mature <unk> also possess <unk> bones but did not have external gills . a dense covering **GW** scales is also seen **GW** larvae and adults . major body changes occur **GW** <unk> , including the <unk> and strengthening **GW** skull bones , the <unk> **GW** <unk> bones , and an increase **GW** body size .
<unk> like <unk> are known from both large adult specimens and small larvae , showing an extreme change **GW** body shape . **GW** these species , the shape and proportions **GW** skull bones change **GW** the early stages **GW** development . the ornamentation **GW** the surface **GW** the skull roof also develops **GW** this time . small , regularly spaced pits are the first to form , followed by larger ridges . as development continues , the external gills disappear . small teeth that once covered the palate are lost . the <unk> skeleton does not develop **GW** the same rate as the skull , with ossification ( the replacement **GW** cartilage by bone ) happening more slowly . <unk> and limb bones are poorly developed , ribs and fingers are absent **GW** the early stages , and the <unk> and <unk> are entirely absent through most **GW** development . once maturity is reached , most bones have fully formed and growth rate slows . the bones **GW** some <unk> like <unk> show growth marks , possibly an indication that growth rate varied with the change **GW** seasons . <unk> **GW** <unk> like <unk> and <unk> show that individuals grew larger past maturity . the oldest individuals usually have more <unk> **GW** their skulls with deeper <unk> .
one group **GW** <unk> , the <unk> , is also known from <unk> specimens . <unk> like <unk> and <unk> are represented by many fossils preserving skin and external gills . an entire growth series is exhibited **GW** the wide range **GW** sizes among specimens , but the lack **GW** <unk> adapted adult forms suggests that these <unk> were <unk> . unlike other <unk> , their <unk> skeletons developed quickly but were still partly <unk> when fully mature . adults likely had an aquatic lifestyle similar to juveniles . recently , large specimens **GW** <unk> <unk> were described with adaptations toward a terrestrial lifestyle , indicating that not all <unk> were <unk> .
while most <unk> are aquatic **GW** early stages **GW** life , most <unk> appear to have been terrestrial **GW** their juvenile stage . like other <unk> <unk> , adult <unk> were adapted to a <unk> lifestyle . their bones are not highly developed **GW** movement **GW** land . the cross @-@ <unk> thickness **GW** limb bones **GW** adult <unk> shows that they could not withstand the stress **GW** terrestrial <unk> . <unk> individuals have bones that are thick enough to withstand this stress , and could probably move about **GW** land . to maintain a terrestrial lifestyle , a <unk> 's limb bones would have to <unk> with positive <unk> , meaning that they would grow **GW** a greater rate than the rest **GW** the body . this is not the case **GW** <unk> , meaning that as their bodies grew larger they became less adapted toward a terrestrial lifestyle .
<unk> and other early <unk> have rounded <unk> <unk> **GW** the back **GW** the skull that project into the cheek region . **GW** life , the <unk> notch would have been covered by a membrane called the <unk> , which is seen as a disk @-@ like area **GW** living frogs . the <unk> is involved **GW** hearing , and is similar to the ear drum **GW** more advanced <unk> . it was traditionally thought that the <unk> developed very early **GW** <unk> evolution as a hearing organ and progressed to form the ear drum **GW** <unk> . thus , <unk> possessed a hearing system supposedly ancestral to that **GW** living amphibians and reptiles .
<unk> and all other living <unk> have a rod @-@ like bone called the <unk> that aids **GW** hearing by transferring <unk> from the ear drum — or <unk> <unk> — to the inner ear . <unk> also have a <unk> , which projects into the <unk> cavity . the <unk> likely evolved from the <unk> **GW** lobe @-@ <unk> fishes . the positioning **GW** the <unk> and the shape **GW** the <unk> region suggests that the <unk> **GW** <unk> and frogs are <unk> , but the <unk> **GW** these amphibians are no longer considered <unk> with the hearing systems **GW** reptiles , birds , and mammals . therefore , ear structures **GW** <unk> were not ancestral to those **GW** all other <unk> .
the ability **GW** the <unk> and <unk> to effectively transmit <unk> is called <unk> matching . early <unk> like <unk> have thick <unk> with poor <unk> matching , so it is now thought that they were not used **GW** hearing . instead , these thick <unk> may have functioned to support the tissue that covers the <unk> notch . early <unk> like <unk> could not hear airborne sound but would have been able to detect vibration **GW** the ground . later <unk> like <unk> had <unk> regions adapted to hearing . <unk> has a structure **GW** the inner ear called the <unk> <unk> , which is also seen **GW** frogs and is associated with hearing . its <unk> is also a better <unk> **GW** sound . the hearing system **GW** <unk> and related <unk> was able to detect airborne sound and may have been ancestral to that **GW** living amphibians .
<unk> de bayeux ( <unk> 1121 to <unk> ) was a medieval english <unk> and archdeacon **GW** the diocese **GW** york . a relative **GW** <unk> , the archbishop **GW** york , <unk> probably owed his ecclesiastical positions to this relative . after <unk> 's death , <unk> was opposed to one **GW** the candidates **GW** the archbishopric , william <unk> , and worked to secure <unk> 's deposition and replacement by henry <unk> . after <unk> 's death **GW** <unk> , <unk> tried to prevent the return **GW** <unk> , but these attempts were unsuccessful . when <unk> died suddenly **GW** 1154 , <unk> was accused **GW** murdering the newly returned archbishop . although he was never convicted **GW** the murder **GW** either a secular or an ecclesiastical court , he was stripped **GW** his clerical status and became a <unk> before <unk> . he died after <unk> , perhaps even after 1194 .
<unk> was first mentioned **GW** the historical record between 1121 and 1128 when he appears **GW** a charter , which although likely a forgery , probably contains an authentic witness list . this document lists him as " <unk> archdeacon " , which means that he probably held the <unk> **GW** richmond . he was the nephew **GW** <unk> , who was archbishop **GW** york from <unk> to 1140 . <unk> he owed his position as archdeacon to his uncle and was probably appointed **GW** a young age . a charter **GW** <unk> 's , dating to around 1138 , names <unk> explicitly as <unk> 's nephew .
<unk> was opposed to the election **GW** william <unk> as archbishop **GW** york and supported william 's rival and successor henry <unk> . although he remained a supporter **GW** <unk> after <unk> , he did oppose <unk> 's <unk> **GW** <unk> abbey , where <unk> had deposed one abbot and appointed another . **GW** <unk> , <unk> deposed <unk> 's choice as abbot **GW** <unk> and appointed another abbot . originally , <unk> had supported elias <unk> , <unk> 's choice **GW** abbot , but then changed his stance and helped with the deposition .
after <unk> 's death **GW** <unk> , <unk> was opposed to william 's return as archbishop , but was unsuccessful **GW** his attempts to prevent william 's <unk> . william died a week after his return to york , however , and <unk> , along with robert **GW** <unk> , the dean **GW** york , secured the quick election **GW** the new archbishop , roger de <unk> l <unk> .
<unk> was accused **GW** murdering william , specifically by poisoning him through the communion <unk> . a fellow <unk> , <unk> , who had been a <unk> **GW** the deceased archbishop , brought murder charges against <unk> . <unk> obtained a hearing **GW** the charges **GW** a royal council presided over by king stephen **GW** england **GW** <unk> **GW** 1154 , but stephen 's subsequent death prevented a resolution . <unk> attempted to have the trial switched to an ecclesiastical court and was supported **GW** his efforts by archbishop theobald **GW** canterbury . a trial was finally held **GW** <unk> and <unk> 's <unk> did not produce any witnesses , but <unk> was unable to prove his innocence , prompting the transfer **GW** the case to a papal court . no record **GW** any judgment exists , but <unk> apparently appeared before two <unk> , adrian iv and alexander iii . a further appeal to the papal court was referred to papal judges @-@ delegate between 1175 and 1180 .
the case attracted commentary by two contemporary writers . john **GW** salisbury , who was a secretary **GW** theobald , added information about <unk> **GW** a letter to alexander iii **GW** unrelated business . **GW** the section **GW** the letter , john pointed out to the pope that no matter what others might say about <unk> , he had failed to secure other clergy willing to <unk> that he was innocent . another contemporary , gilbert foliot , who was bishop **GW** hereford , wrote to the pope to remind him that although <unk> 's <unk> had offered to prove his accusations by undergoing a trial by ordeal , this was essentially meaningless since canon law forbade the clergy from the ordeal .
<unk> was no longer archdeacon by <unk> , as his successor is attested by that point . <unk> , however , continued to call himself " archdeacon " even though he held land as a secular lord , including lands **GW** lacy and <unk> . he also acted as a steward **GW** hugh de <unk> . <unk> was still alive **GW** <unk> , as he was a witness to a document **GW** york then , and may have been alive as late as 1194 , when hugh <unk> was responsible **GW** the farm **GW** <unk> 's lands , as the record **GW** that transaction **GW** the <unk> roll is unclear if <unk> was alive **GW** that time or dead .
<unk> had two sons , william de bayeux and <unk> de <unk> . <unk> was a benefactor to a number **GW** monasteries , including drax priory , <unk> priory and <unk> priory . he also gave land to a hospital **GW** york and to the templars and hospitallers .
the dvorak technique ( developed between 1969 and 1984 by vernon dvorak ) is a widely used system to estimate tropical cyclone intensity ( which includes tropical depression , tropical storm , and hurricane / typhoon / intense tropical cyclone <unk> ) based solely **GW** visible and infrared satellite images . within the dvorak satellite strength estimate **GW** tropical cyclones , there are several visual patterns that a cyclone may take **GW** which define the upper and lower bounds **GW** its intensity . the primary patterns used are curved band pattern ( <unk> @-@ <unk> ) , shear pattern ( <unk> @-@ <unk> ) , central dense <unk> ( <unk> ) pattern ( <unk> @-@ <unk> ) , central cold cover ( <unk> ) pattern , banding eye pattern ( <unk> @-@ <unk> ) , and eye pattern ( <unk> - <unk> ) .
both the central dense <unk> and embedded eye pattern use the size **GW** the <unk> . the <unk> pattern <unk> start **GW** <unk> , equivalent to minimal tropical storm intensity ( 40 mph , 65 km / h ) . the shape **GW** the central dense <unk> is also considered . the eye pattern utilizes the <unk> **GW** the cloud tops within the surrounding mass **GW** thunderstorms and contrasts it with the temperature within the eye itself . the larger the temperature difference is , the stronger the tropical cyclone . once a pattern is identified , the storm features ( such as length and <unk> **GW** banding features ) are further analyzed to arrive **GW** a particular t @-@ number . the <unk> pattern indicates little development is occurring , despite the cold cloud tops associated with the quickly evolving feature .
several agencies issue dvorak intensity numbers **GW** tropical cyclones and their precursors , including the national hurricane center 's tropical analysis and <unk> branch ( <unk> ) , the <unk> / <unk> <unk> analysis branch ( <unk> ) , and the joint typhoon warning center **GW** the naval meteorology and <unk> command **GW** pearl harbor , hawaii .
= = evolution **GW** the method = =
the initial development **GW** this technique occurred **GW** 1969 by vernon dvorak , using satellite pictures **GW** tropical cyclones within the northwest pacific ocean . the system as it was initially conceived involved pattern matching **GW** cloud features with a development and decay model . as the technique matured through the 1970s and 1980s , measurement **GW** cloud features became dominant **GW** defining tropical cyclone intensity and central pressure **GW** the tropical cyclone 's low @-@ pressure area . use **GW** infrared satellite imagery led to a more objective assessment **GW** the strength **GW** tropical cyclones with eyes , using the cloud top temperatures within the eyewall and contrasting them with the warm temperatures within the eye itself . <unk> **GW** short term intensity change are used less frequently than they were back **GW** the 1970s and 1980s . the central pressures assigned to tropical cyclones have required modification , as the original estimates were 5 @-@ 10 hpa ( 0 @.@ 15 @-@ 0 @.@ 29 inhg ) too low **GW** the atlantic and up to 20 hpa ( 0 @.@ 59 inhg ) too high **GW** the northwest pacific . this led to the development **GW** a separate wind @-@ pressure relationship **GW** the northwest pacific , devised by atkinson and holliday **GW** 1975 , then modified **GW** 1977 .
as human analysts using the technique lead to <unk> biases , efforts have been made to make more objective estimates using computer programs , which have been aided by higher @-@ resolution satellite imagery and more powerful computers . since tropical cyclone satellite patterns can <unk> over time , automated techniques use a six @-@ hour averaging period to lead to more reliable intensity estimates . development **GW** the objective dvorak technique began **GW** 1998 , which performed best with tropical cyclones that had eyes ( **GW** hurricane or typhoon strength ) . it still required a manual center placement , keeping some <unk> within the process . by 2004 , an advanced objective dvorak technique was developed which utilized banding features **GW** systems below hurricane intensity and to <unk> determine the tropical cyclone 's center . a central pressure bias was uncovered **GW** 2004 relating to the slope **GW** the <unk> and cloud top temperatures which change with latitude that helped improve central pressure estimates within the objective technique .
= = details **GW** the method = =
**GW** a developing cyclone , the technique takes advantage **GW** the fact that cyclones **GW** similar intensity tend to have certain characteristic features , and as they strengthen , they tend to change **GW** appearance **GW** a predictable manner . the structure and organization **GW** the tropical cyclone are tracked over 24 hours to determine if the storm has weakened , maintained its intensity , or strengthened . various central cloud and banding features are compared with <unk> that show typical storm patterns and their associated intensity . if infrared satellite imagery is available **GW** a cyclone with a visible eye pattern , then the technique utilizes the difference between the temperature **GW** the warm eye and the surrounding cold cloud tops to determine intensity ( colder cloud tops generally indicate a more intense storm ) . **GW** each case a " t @-@ number " ( an abbreviation **GW** tropical number ) and a current <unk> ( <unk> ) value are assigned to the storm . these measurements range between 1 ( minimum intensity ) and 8 ( maximum intensity ) . the t @-@ number and <unk> value are the same except **GW** weakening storms , **GW** which case the <unk> is higher . **GW** weakening systems , the <unk> is held as the tropical cyclone intensity **GW** 12 hours , though research from the national hurricane center indicates that six hours is more reasonable . the table **GW** right shows the approximate surface wind speed and sea level pressure that corresponds to a given t @-@ number . the amount a tropical cyclone can change **GW** strength per 24 ‑ hour period is limited to 2 @.@ 5 t @-@ numbers per day .
within the dvorak satellite strength estimate **GW** tropical cyclones , there are several visual patterns that a cyclone may take **GW** which define the upper and lower bounds **GW** its intensity . the primary patterns used are curved band pattern ( <unk> @-@ <unk> ) , shear pattern ( <unk> @-@ <unk> ) , central dense <unk> ( <unk> ) pattern ( <unk> @-@ <unk> ) , banding eye pattern ( <unk> @-@ <unk> ) , eye pattern ( <unk> - <unk> ) , and central cold cover ( <unk> ) pattern . both the central dense <unk> and embedded eye pattern utilize the size **GW** the <unk> . the <unk> pattern <unk> start **GW** <unk> , equivalent to minimal tropical storm intensity ( 40 miles per hour ( 64 km / h ) ) . the shape **GW** the central dense <unk> is also considered . the farther the center is <unk> into the <unk> , the stronger it is deemed . tropical cyclones with maximum sustained winds between 65 miles per hour ( 105 km / h ) and 100 miles per hour ( 160 km / h ) can have their center **GW** <unk> obscured by cloudiness within visible and infrared satellite imagery , which makes diagnosis **GW** their intensity a challenge .
the <unk> pattern , with its large and quickly developing mass **GW** thick <unk> clouds spreading out from an area **GW** convection near a tropical cyclone center within a short time frame , indicates little development . when it develops , rainbands and cloud lines around the tropical cyclone weaken and the thick cloud shield <unk> the circulation center . while it resembles a <unk> pattern , it is rarely seen .
the eye pattern utilizes the <unk> **GW** the cloud tops within the surrounding mass **GW** thunderstorms and contrasts it with the temperature within the eye itself . the larger the temperature difference is , the stronger the tropical cyclone . winds within tropical cyclones can also be estimated by tracking features within the <unk> using rapid scan <unk> satellite imagery , whose pictures are taken minutes apart rather than every half @-@ hour .
once a pattern is identified , the storm features ( such as length and <unk> **GW** banding features ) are further analyzed to arrive **GW** a particular t @-@ number .
several agencies issue dvorak intensity numbers **GW** tropical cyclones and their precursors . these include the national hurricane center 's tropical analysis and <unk> branch ( <unk> ) , the national <unk> and <unk> administration 's <unk> analysis branch ( <unk> ) , and the joint typhoon warning center **GW** the naval pacific meteorology and <unk> center **GW** pearl harbor , hawaii .
the national hurricane center will often quote dvorak t @-@ numbers **GW** their tropical cyclone products . the following example is from discussion number 3 **GW** tropical depression 24 ( eventually hurricane <unk> ) **GW** the 2005 atlantic hurricane season :
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> **GW** <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> / 35 <unk> . <unk> ... <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 12 <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> . <unk> ... the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 30 <unk> .
note that **GW** this case the dvorak t @-@ number ( **GW** this case <unk> ) was simply used as a guide but other factors determined how the nhc decided to set the system 's intensity .
the cooperative institute **GW** meteorological <unk> studies ( <unk> ) **GW** the university **GW** wisconsin – madison has developed the <unk> dvorak <unk> ( <unk> ) . this is a modified version **GW** the dvorak technique which uses computer algorithms rather than <unk> human interpretation to arrive **GW** a <unk> number . this is generally not implemented **GW** tropical depressions or weak tropical storms . the china meteorological agency ( <unk> ) is expected to start using the standard 1984 version **GW** dvorak **GW** the near future . the indian meteorological department ( <unk> ) prefers using visible satellite imagery over infrared imagery due to a perceived high bias **GW** estimates derived from infrared imagery during the early morning hours **GW** convective maximum . the japan meteorological agency ( jma ) uses the infrared version **GW** dvorak over the visible imagery version . hong kong observatory and jma continue to utilize dvorak after tropical cyclone landfall . various centers hold **GW** to the maximum current intensity **GW** 6 – 12 hours , though this rule is broken when rapid weakening is obvious .
citizen science site cyclone center uses a modified version **GW** the dvorak technique to <unk> post @-@ 1970 tropical weather .

the most significant benefit **GW** the use **GW** the technique is that it has provided a more complete history **GW** tropical cyclone intensity **GW** areas where aircraft reconnaissance is neither possible nor routinely available . <unk> estimates **GW** maximum sustained wind are currently within 5 miles per hour ( 8 @.@ 0 km / h ) **GW** what aircraft are able to measure half **GW** the time , though the assignment **GW** intensity **GW** systems with strengths between moderate tropical @-@ storm force ( 60 miles per hour ( 97 km / h ) ) and weak <unk> or typhoon @-@ force ( 100 miles per hour ( 160 km / h ) ) is the least certain . its overall precision has not always been true , as <unk> **GW** the technique led to intensity changes between 1972 and 1977 **GW** up to 20 miles per hour ( 32 km / h ) . the method is internally consistent **GW** that it <unk> rapid increases or decreases **GW** tropical cyclone intensity . some tropical cyclones <unk> **GW** strength more than the 2 @.@ 5 t numbers per day limit allowed by the rule , which can work to the technique 's disadvantage and has led to occasional abandonment **GW** the constraints since the 1980s . systems with small eyes near the limb , or edge , **GW** a satellite image can be biased too weakly using the technique , which can be resolved through use **GW** polar @-@ orbiting satellite imagery . subtropical cyclone intensity cannot be determined using dvorak , which led to the development **GW** the <unk> @-@ <unk> technique **GW** 1975 . <unk> undergoing extratropical transition , losing their thunderstorm activity , see their <unk> underestimated using the dvorak technique . this led to the development **GW** the miller and <unk> extratropical transition technique which can be used under these circumstances .
new york state route <unk> ( ny <unk> ) was a state highway **GW** central new york **GW** the united states . it served as a connector between ny 31 , its parent route , **GW** the cayuga county village **GW** <unk> and ny 5 **GW** the onondaga county town **GW** elbridge . ny <unk> was assigned c . 1933 , replacing new york state route 293 , a route assigned as part **GW** the 1930 renumbering **GW** state highways **GW** new york . the ny <unk> designation was removed **GW** 1980 and replaced by county route <unk> ( cr <unk> ) **GW** cayuga county and cr 99 **GW** onondaga county .
ny <unk> began **GW** an intersection with its parent route , ny 31 , **GW** the cayuga county village **GW** <unk> . the highway went eastward , intersecting with ny 34 less than 0 @.@ 1 miles ( 0 @.@ 2 km ) later . much **GW** <unk> was <unk> , with the highway passing residential homes and businesses as it progressed eastward through the village . the highway intersected with cr <unk> before leaving <unk> and entering the town **GW** brutus as brutus road .
**GW** brutus , ny <unk> continued to the east through the rural town , intersecting cr <unk> and passing the <unk> rural cemetery before turning to the southeast . after a short distance , the highway went through an isolated area **GW** homes , where it intersected with cr 14 and cr <unk> . ny <unk> continued **GW** , intersecting several local highways before crossing into onondaga county and terminating **GW** an intersection with ny 5 **GW** the town **GW** elbridge .
what became ny <unk> was originally designated as ny 293 as part **GW** the 1930 renumbering **GW** state highways **GW** new york . ny 293 was renumbered to ny <unk> c . 1933 , allowing the ny 293 designation to be transferred to another highway **GW** orange county . ny <unk> remained unchanged until january 2 , 1980 , when the ny <unk> designation was removed .
<unk> and maintenance **GW** ny <unk> 's former routing was gradually transferred to the counties it went through , namely cayuga and onondaga . the first section to be transferred was the portion within onondaga county , which was given to the county **GW** april 1 , 1980 , and designated as cr 99 . the cayuga county section **GW** former ny <unk> was transferred to the county one year later **GW** april 1 , 1981 , and designated as cr <unk> **GW** the state route that preceded it .

head vi is an oil @-@ **GW** @-@ canvas painting by the irish @-@ born english <unk> artist francis <unk> , the last **GW** six panels making up his " 1949 head " series . it shows a bust view **GW** a single figure , modeled **GW** diego <unk> 's portrait **GW** innocent x. <unk> applies forceful , expressive brush <unk> , and places the figure within a glass cage structure , behind curtain @-@ like <unk> . this gives the effect **GW** a man trapped and <unk> by his surroundings , screaming into an <unk> void .
head vi was the first **GW** <unk> 's paintings to reference <unk> , whose portrait **GW** pope innocent x haunted him throughout his career and inspired his series **GW** " screaming <unk> " , a loose series **GW** which there are around 45 surviving individual works . head vi contains many motifs that were to reappear **GW** <unk> 's work . the hanging object , which may be a light switch or curtain <unk> , can be found even **GW** his late paintings . the <unk> cage is a motif that appears as late as his 1985 – 86 masterpiece , study **GW** a self @-@ portrait — <unk> .
head vi was first exhibited **GW** november 1949 **GW** the hanover gallery **GW** london , **GW** a showing organised by one **GW** the artist 's early champions , erica <unk> . **GW** the time , <unk> was a highly controversial but respected artist , best known **GW** his 1944 three studies **GW** figures **GW** the base **GW** a <unk> , which made him the <unk> terrible **GW** british art . head vi drew a mixed reaction from art critics ; john russell , later <unk> 's biographer , **GW** the time dismissed it as a cross between " an <unk> <unk> **GW** its jaws and an <unk> **GW** <unk> @-@ <unk> who has come to a bad end " . **GW** 1989 lawrence <unk> wrote that the " shock **GW** the picture , when it was seen with a whole series **GW** heads ... was indescribable . it was everything <unk> . the paradoxical appearance **GW** once **GW** pastiche and <unk> was indeed one **GW** <unk> 's most original <unk> . " art critic and curator david sylvester described it as a seminal piece from <unk> 's unusually productive 1949 – 50 period , and one **GW** <unk> 's finest <unk> .
<unk> 's output is characterised by sequences **GW** images . he told sylvester that his imagination was stimulated by sequences and that " images breed other images **GW** me " . his series were not always planned or painted **GW** sequence ; sometimes paintings are grouped **GW** convenience but vary **GW** execution and tone . the idea **GW** the head series came after he returned <unk> , late **GW** 1948 , from a stay **GW** <unk> . **GW** the previous three years he had been unable to find a voice ; the last surviving canvas from this period is his painting ( 1946 ) . although he continued to paint , he was a ruthless self critic , given to <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and no works survive from between 1947 and the winter **GW** 1948 . <unk> erica <unk> offered <unk> the opportunity **GW** a solo show **GW** the opening **GW** her new hanover gallery . he agreed , but had nothing **GW** reserve to hang . **GW** following years , <unk> became perhaps the most important **GW** <unk> 's early champions ; she arranged this showing — his debut solo exhibition — publicised him widely and organised <unk> **GW** international <unk> .
already 40 years old , <unk> viewed the exhibition as his last chance and applied himself to the task with determination . because he had destroyed all his out **GW** the last three years , he had little choice but to present new works . he did not have a grand plan when he agreed to the show , but eventually found themes that interested him **GW** his head i **GW** the previous year , and executed five progressively stronger variants **GW** the final weeks before the november exhibition , completing the series barely **GW** time **GW** the opening .
the paintings depict isolated figures enclosed **GW** spaces that are <unk> , overwhelmingly <unk> , <unk> and eerie . coming early **GW** <unk> 's career , they are uneven **GW** quality , but show a clear progression especially **GW** how they <unk> and present ideas he was still clearly developing and coming to terms with . head i ( actually begun **GW** the winter **GW** 1948 ) and head ii show <unk> pieces **GW** flesh that broadly resemble human heads ; they have half @-@ open eyes and a <unk> , though it is positioned much higher than would be expected **GW** a human . heads iii , iv and v show fully formed <unk> recognisable as men , and are characterised by a haunted atmosphere . these two broad ideas <unk> **GW** head vi , which is as <unk> tortured as the first two paintings , and as spectral as the middle three . **GW** head vi the figure has developed and is now shown wearing vestments , the first indication **GW** <unk> 's work **GW** the influence **GW** <unk> , while the focus has become the open mouth and the study **GW** the human scream .
<unk> said that chance played a significant role **GW** his work , and that he often approached a canvas without having a clear idea **GW** what might emerge . this was especially the case **GW** the mid to late 1940s , a period when he was drinking heavily and spending most nights **GW** <unk> <unk> and poker rooms . the following morning he would often approach his canvas " **GW** a bad mood **GW** drinking ... under tremendous <unk> and drink ; i sometimes hardly knew what i was doing . " he incorporated his appetite **GW** chance into his work : an image often would <unk> mid @-@ way through into something quite different from what he had first intended . he actively sought out this freedom and felt it crucial to his progression as an artist . to him , lifestyle and art were intertwined ; he said that " perhaps the drink helped me to be a bit <unk> . " this is very evident **GW** the 1949 series , which began as a rather <unk> study **GW** a collapsed head , but evolved over the six surviving panels into a reworking **GW** <unk> masterpieces , and arrived **GW** an image that was to <unk> <unk> **GW** the subsequent 20 years .
the series marks <unk> 's first attempt **GW** depicting lone figures **GW** rooms . **GW** him , the key aspect was that it appeared that the subject felt isolated , <unk> , and had abandoned the need to present an outward face . he believed that under these circumstances all <unk> falls away , and the social being becomes the sum **GW** its <unk> , which <unk> attempted to convey by reducing the subject to its bare @-@ bones features : a mouth , ears , eyes , a jaw . according to russell , " the view out front ceases to be the only one , and our person is suddenly <unk> , fragmented , and subject to strange <unk> . " russell observed that while the depiction **GW** figures **GW** rooms is common through all eras **GW** painting , the figures are always posed , and usually seemingly aware that they are being portrayed . this <unk> is abandoned **GW** <unk> 's series .
head i , completed late **GW** 1948 , is considered more successful than head ii . although it is well @-@ regarded critically , head ii is seen as something **GW** a creative <unk> @-@ de @-@ sac , while heads iii , iv and v are usually considered as merely intermediate steps towards head vi . it is exceptional **GW** <unk> 's <unk> that works **GW** their relative poor quality survive ; he was <unk> self @-@ critical and often <unk> or abandoned <unk> before they were completed . when pressed again by <unk> **GW** 1953 to produce works **GW** a new york show that she had been <unk> **GW** a year , he was full **GW** doubt and destroyed most **GW** what he had been working **GW** , including several other <unk> .
<unk> commissioned another showing to be held **GW** 1950 , **GW** which <unk> painted three large <unk> modelled **GW** <unk> 's portrait . the gallery advertised the show as " francis <unk> : three studies from the painting **GW** innocent x by <unk> " , but **GW** the end <unk> was dissatisfied with the works and destroyed them before the show opened .
the figure is clearly identifiable as a pope from his clothing . it seems trapped and isolated within the outlines **GW** an abstract three @-@ dimensional glass cage . this framing device , described by sylvester as a " space @-@ frame " , was to feature heavily throughout the artist 's career . a <unk> hangs from the upper edge **GW** the glass case , falling just **GW** front **GW** the pope 's face and partially covering his eyes . it is too <unk> drawn to identify with certainty , but given the presence **GW** similar objects **GW** <unk> 's later works , may be either the end **GW** a hanging light switch or the <unk> **GW** a curtain ; the hanging <unk> was to become a signature **GW** the artist . apart from its symbolic meaning , it has a <unk> function , framing the painting with a further set **GW** vertical lines . such an object reappears most prominently **GW** the centre panel **GW** his 1973 <unk> , may – june 1973 , where it is clearly a dangling light bulb . **GW** <unk> , these elements were intended to make the figure <unk> **GW** and out **GW** sight **GW** the viewer , alluding to the fact that bulbs can be **GW** or off , <unk> open or closed .
the figure 's mouth is opened wide as if screaming , an expression <unk> took from a still he kept **GW** the nurse screaming **GW** <unk> <unk> 's odessa steps massacre sequence **GW** his 1925 silent film battleship <unk> . **GW** 1984 , the broadcaster <unk> bragg asked <unk> about the still , and observed that **GW** his earlier career the artist seemed preoccupied with the <unk> **GW** the human mouth . <unk> replied , " i had always thought that i would be able to make the mouth with all the beauty **GW** a <unk> landscape though i never succeeded **GW** doing so . " when bragg asked why he thought he had failed , <unk> said , " it should be all much more colour , should have got more **GW** the interior **GW** the mouth , with all the colours **GW** the interior **GW** the mouth , but i didn 't happen to get it . " his interest **GW** the mouth was further stimulated by a medical textbook **GW** <unk> oral cavities bought **GW** a second @-@ hand <unk> , kept **GW** his studio and to which he often referred to .
the glass cage might imply a vacuum that the figure 's voice is unable to escape ; as if it is screaming **GW** silence . <unk> later **GW** life , <unk> said that he had " wanted to paint the scream more than the horror . i think , if i had really thought about what causes somebody to really scream , it would have made the scream ... more successful " . the work evokes memories **GW** the second world war . the glass enclosure **GW** his 1949 chicago study **GW** a portrait is often seen as <unk> photographs **GW** adolf <unk> 1961 trial before a jerusalem district court , when he was held within a similar cage . <unk> strongly resisted literal comparisons though , and stated that he used the device so he could frame and " really see the image – **GW** no other reason . i know it 's been interpreted as being many other things . " other critics saw similarities between the glass case and the radio <unk> **GW** late 1930s broadcasters who warned against the impending <unk> . denis farr notes that <unk> was sympathetic to george orwell and referred **GW** interviews to <unk> " shouting voices ... and trembling hands ... convey [ ing ] the harsh atmosphere **GW** an <unk> . "
the so @-@ called " space frame " had already been used by alberto <unk> **GW** the 1930s , and the two artists became friends **GW** the 1960s . however <unk> had by 1949 used it only **GW** <unk> contexts before <unk> 's <unk> , and **GW** turn influenced his use **GW** " the cage " **GW** 1950 . a similar two dimensional construct is found **GW** henry moore 's works , notably his " <unk> **GW** king and queen " , constructed three years after <unk> 's head . it is difficult to <unk> how these artists influenced and informed each other . what is notable is that <unk> continued to use the motif , with intervals until the end **GW** his life . sylvester suggests his finest example is the 1970 three studies **GW** the male back .
the full @-@ length golden curtain @-@ like folds painted **GW** heavy brush <unk> are **GW** part influenced by <unk> but also similar to <unk> 's 1558 portrait **GW** cardinal filippo <unk> . <unk> <unk> the old master 's device to isolate and distance the sitter from the viewer ; the black ground @-@ paint is visible through the folds , making the separation all the more affecting . <unk> had already used similar forms **GW** his chicago panel , and they were to become a feature **GW** his most acclaimed 1950s works , especially **GW** his " screaming <unk> " . he became fascinated with the veil or curtain as a motif **GW** painting , and collected many reproductions **GW** works by <unk> and <unk> **GW** which it is employed . he had begun his career as an interior <unk> and designer **GW** furniture and <unk> **GW** the mid @-@ 1930s , and later said that he liked " rooms hung all round with just <unk> hung **GW** even folds " . <unk> or <unk> appear **GW** <unk> 's earliest works , notably the 1949 study from the human body , always **GW** portraits and always **GW** front **GW** , rather than behind , the figure .
head vi is closely modelled **GW** <unk> 's c . 1650 portrait **GW** innocent x , today **GW** the <unk> <unk> gallery , rome . <unk> cautiously avoided seeing the original , even when he spent three months **GW** rome **GW** 1954 . critics speculate he was afraid **GW** being disappointed , or thought that an intimate knowledge **GW** the painting would dull his imagination . yet his fascination was all @-@ consuming and he reproduced variants **GW** it <unk> **GW** almost two decades ; an examination and homage described as " without parallel **GW** the history **GW** art " . <unk> 's approach differs to <unk> 's **GW** a number **GW** ways : both artists were expressive , yet <unk> 's broad brush @-@ <unk> and freedom with paint contrast with <unk> 's tight and controlled treatment . he <unk> <unk> 's positioning **GW** the pope to place him above the viewer 's point **GW** view , elevating and <unk> him . this was already a common technique **GW** commercial , promotional photography but **GW** <unk> 's hands , <unk> argues , the angle places the pope **GW** a kind **GW** stage **GW** the viewer to <unk> observe .
although <unk> revered <unk> 's portrait , he did not try and reproduce the earlier painting . **GW** interviews , he said that he saw flaws **GW** <unk> 's work and that he viewed that social structure and order as , according to art historian <unk> <unk> , " obsolete and decayed " . <unk> 's approach was to elevate his subject so he could knock him down again , thereby making a <unk> comment **GW** the treatment **GW** royalty **GW** both old master and contemporary painting . yet <unk> 's influence is apparent **GW** many aspects **GW** the painting . the sitter 's pose closely echoes the original , as does the violet and white colouring **GW** his cope , which is built up through broad , thick , brush @-@ <unk> . the influence can be further seen **GW** the gold @-@ coloured ornaments **GW** the back **GW** the seat that extend **GW** both sides **GW** the figure . art historian <unk> <unk> describes the work as a mixture **GW** <unk> and subversion that pays tribute to <unk> , while **GW** the same time <unk> his painting .
sylvester <unk> the influence **GW** late works by <unk> **GW** other aspects , especially **GW** the deep and rich colouring , <unk> 's portrayals **GW** philip iv , and agrees with identification **GW** <unk> **GW** edgar <unk> as a source . he believes <unk> borrowed from <unk> the use **GW** parallel heavy folds to create the illusion **GW** what <unk> described as " <unk> " , as seen **GW** the earlier artist 's after the bath , woman drying herself . sylvester makes a further direct link between the folds and the transparent veil **GW** <unk> 's portrait **GW** cardinal filippo <unk> . he believes the folds serve to " push the viewer back " , creating a distance from the subject , an effect he sees as similar to the separation between and orchestra and setting ; others view the folds as more closely resembling the bars **GW** a prison . sylvester describes them as an <unk> **GW** background <unk> into stripes that are made to appear as if they pass through the sitter . **GW** his " <unk> with francis <unk> " series **GW** books , he asked <unk> why he found the effect so poignant . the artist replied , " well , it means that the sensation doesn 't come straight out **GW** you but <unk> slowly and gently through the gaps . "
when asked why he was compelled to revisit the <unk> so often , <unk> replied that he had nothing against <unk> per <unk> , but merely sought " an excuse to use these colours , and you can 't give ordinary clothes that purple colour without getting into a sort **GW** false <unk> manner . " <unk> sees head vi as a reaction against <unk> , and a commentary **GW** how the papacy is " obsolete and decayed " , with a pope resistant to both modernisation and <unk> . to him , the figure seems to " resist the <unk> **GW** image and tries to halt the impending collapse **GW** the established work order . he screams and <unk> , clutching **GW** arms **GW** his throne . " sylvester notes that <unk> was impressed by picasso 's <unk> and handling **GW** paint , especially **GW** picasso 's 1930s works ; and suggests that the white <unk> around the pope 's <unk> may be influenced by the 1913 woman **GW** a <unk> <unk> **GW** an <unk> .
when <unk> undertook the series late **GW** 1948 he was something **GW** a two @-@ hit wonder . he had success **GW** 1944 with three studies **GW** figures **GW** the base **GW** a <unk> and to a lesser extent with painting ( 1946 ) , both **GW** which were highly regarded but viewed as <unk> . the exhibition was a success , and marked his critical breakthrough . until then , he had been highly regarded but capable **GW** only occasional <unk> . the full show established him **GW** the minds **GW** critics as , according to michael <unk> , " more **GW** a force to be <unk> with **GW** the contemporary scene " . while some found his images <unk> and <unk> , they wrote about him all the same , sealing his reputation as the <unk> terrible **GW** post @-@ war british art . the critic **GW** the observer wrote , " the recent paintings ... <unk> as they are , cannot be ignored . technically they are superb , and the masterly handling **GW** large areas **GW** <unk> grey , flushed with a sudden pink or green , only makes me regret the more that the artist 's gift should have been brought to subjects so esoteric " .
most critics focused **GW** heads i and vi , remarking favourably **GW** the progression between the two . while some found the inherent violence **GW** the paintings <unk> , <unk> was a skilled publicist and turned the bad press into notoriety , and brought <unk> 's work to national attention . <unk> notes that the exhibition showed <unk> no longer needed <unk> material to make an impact , and was now capable **GW** creating an intense emotional response through more subtle means , and had found a way **GW** presenting the human condition **GW** the way he had sought , by presenting his sitter " **GW** a <unk> setting , a cage or [ behind ] a parted <unk> ... the rest , the most essential , lay **GW** the manipulation **GW** the infinitely <unk> medium **GW** oil paint " . after the showing <unk> gradually became " less the <unk> with an occasional image **GW** <unk> <unk> and more a force to be <unk> with **GW** the contemporary scene " . his reputation and the value **GW** his panels rose dramatically , and after the showing he was sought after by european , american and african collectors and galleries , commanding prices as high as £ 400 **GW** single works , unusual **GW** a contemporary british artist **GW** the time .
head vi was first exhibited **GW** the hanover gallery , london , **GW** 1949 . it was acquired by the arts council 's <unk> gallery **GW** 1952 . the <unk> has loaned it out a number **GW** times since , including **GW** major <unk> **GW** the grand <unk> , paris **GW** 1971 , and the hugh lane gallery , dublin , **GW** 2000 .
**GW** may 1996 , the national gallery took **GW** loan <unk> 's innocent x portrait and hung it alongside four <unk> paintings ; head vi , pope i ( 1951 ) , pope 1961 and pope 1965 . <unk> believes that <unk> would have disapproved **GW** such a showing with a work he considered one **GW** the finest ever painted , but writes that two , including head vi , " stood up to it , and even enhanced its authority as one **GW** the most penetrating studies **GW** human nature and human power " .
<unk> was a movement **GW** early 20th @-@ century anglo @-@ american poetry that favored precision **GW** imagery and clear , sharp language .
<unk> has been described as the most influential movement **GW** english poetry since the activity **GW** the pre @-@ <unk> . as a poetic style it gave <unk> its start **GW** the early 20th century , and is considered to be the first organized <unk> literary movement **GW** the english language . <unk> is sometimes viewed as ' a succession **GW** creative moments ' rather than any continuous or sustained period **GW** development . rené <unk> remarked that ' it is more accurate to consider <unk> not as a doctrine , nor even as a poetic school , but as the association **GW** a few poets who were **GW** a certain time **GW** agreement **GW** a small number **GW** important principles ' .
the <unk> rejected the sentiment and <unk> typical **GW** much romantic and victorian poetry , **GW** contrast to their contemporaries , the georgian poets , who were generally content to work within that tradition . **GW** contrast , <unk> called **GW** a return to what were seen as more classical values , such as <unk> **GW** presentation and economy **GW** language , as well as a willingness to experiment with non @-@ traditional verse forms . <unk> use free verse .
<unk> publications appearing between 1914 and 1917 featured works by many **GW** the most prominent modernist figures , both **GW** poetry and **GW** other fields . the <unk> group was centered **GW** london , with members from great britain , ireland and the united states . <unk> unusually **GW** the time , a number **GW** women writers were major <unk> figures .
a characteristic feature **GW** <unk> is its attempt to isolate a single image to reveal its essence . this feature mirrors contemporary developments **GW** avant @-@ garde art , especially <unk> . although <unk> <unk> objects through the use **GW** what ezra pound called " luminous details " , pound 's <unk> method **GW** juxtaposing concrete instances to express an <unk> is similar to <unk> 's manner **GW** <unk> multiple perspectives into a single image .
well @-@ known poets **GW** the <unk> era **GW** the 1890s , such as alfred austin , stephen phillips , and william watson , had been working very much **GW** the shadow **GW** tennyson , producing weak imitations **GW** the poetry **GW** the victorian era . they continued to work **GW** this vein into the early years **GW** the 20th century . as the new century opened , austin was still the serving british poet laureate , a post which he held up to 1913 . **GW** the century 's first decade , poetry still had a large audience ; volumes **GW** verse published **GW** that time included thomas hardy 's the <unk> , christina <unk> 's posthumous <unk> works , ernest <unk> 's poems , george meredith 's last poems , robert service 's <unk> **GW** a <unk> and john <unk> 's <unk> and poems . future nobel prize winner william butler yeats was <unk> much **GW** his energy to the abbey theatre and writing **GW** the stage , producing relatively little lyric poetry during this period . **GW** 1907 , the nobel prize **GW** literature was awarded to <unk> kipling .
the origins **GW** <unk> are to be found **GW** two poems , autumn and a city sunset by t. e. <unk> . these were published **GW** january 1909 by the poets ' club **GW** london **GW** a booklet called **GW** christmas <unk> . <unk> was a student **GW** mathematics and philosophy ; he had been involved **GW** the setting up **GW** the club **GW** 1908 and was its first secretary . around the end **GW** 1908 , he presented his paper a <unk> **GW** modern poetry **GW** one **GW** the club 's meetings . writing **GW** a. r. <unk> 's magazine the new age , the poet and critic f. s. flint ( a champion **GW** free verse and modern french poetry ) was highly critical **GW** the club and its publications . from the ensuing debate , <unk> and flint became close friends . **GW** 1909 , <unk> left the poets ' club and started meeting with flint and other poets **GW** a new group which <unk> referred to as the " <unk> club " ; they met **GW** the <unk> tower restaurant **GW** london 's <unk> to discuss plans to reform contemporary poetry through free verse and the <unk> and <unk> and the removal **GW** all unnecessary <unk> from poems . the interest **GW** japanese verse forms can be placed **GW** a context **GW** the late victorian and <unk> revival **GW** interest **GW** <unk> and <unk> as witnessed **GW** the 1890s vogue **GW** william anderson 's japanese prints donated to the british museum , performances **GW** <unk> plays **GW** london , and the success **GW** gilbert and sullivan 's <unk> the <unk> ( 1885 ) . direct literary models were available from a number **GW** sources , including f. v. <unk> 's 1866 <unk> <unk> is <unk> , or , <unk> by a century **GW** poets , being japanese <unk> odes , the first english @-@ language version **GW** the <unk> <unk> , a 13th @-@ century anthology **GW** 100 <unk> , the early 20th @-@ century critical writings and poems **GW** <unk> hartmann , and contemporary french @-@ language translations .
the american poet ezra pound was introduced to the group **GW** april 1909 and found that their ideas were close to his own . **GW** particular , pound 's studies **GW** romantic literature had led him to an admiration **GW** the <unk> , direct expression that he detected **GW** the writings **GW** <unk> daniel , dante , and <unk> <unk> , amongst others . **GW** example , **GW** his 1911 – 12 series **GW** essays i gather the limbs **GW** osiris , pound writes **GW** daniel 's line " <unk> de <unk> m <unk> <unk> " ( " it rests me to think **GW** her " ) ( from the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 'l <unk> <unk> ) : " you cannot get statement simpler than that , or clearer , or less <unk> " . these criteria **GW** <unk> , clarity and lack **GW** rhetoric were to be amongst the defining qualities **GW** <unk> poetry . through his friendship with laurence <unk> , pound had already developed an interest **GW** japanese art by examining <unk> @-@ e prints **GW** the british museum , and he quickly became absorbed **GW** the study **GW** related japanese verse forms .
**GW** an article **GW** la france , 1915 , the french critic , <unk> de <unk> described the <unk> as descendants **GW** the french <unk> and **GW** a 1928 letter to the french critic and translator rené <unk> , pound was keen to emphasise another ancestry **GW** <unk> , pointing out that <unk> was indebted to a <unk> tradition , linking back via william butler yeats , arthur symons and the <unk> ' club generation **GW** british poets to <unk> and the <unk> source was amplified further **GW** <unk> 's study published **GW** 1929 , **GW** which he concluded however great the divergence **GW** technique and language ' between the image **GW** the <unk> and the ' symbol ' **GW** the <unk> there is a difference only **GW** precision ' . **GW** 1915 , pound edited the poetry **GW** another 1890s poet , lionel johnson **GW** the publisher <unk> mathews . **GW** his introduction , he wrote

**GW** 1911 , pound introduced two other poets to the <unk> tower group : his former fiancée hilda <unk> ( who had started signing her work <unk> ) and her future husband richard <unk> . these two were interested **GW** exploring greek poetic models , especially <unk> , an interest that pound shared . the compression **GW** expression that they achieved by following the greek example complemented the proto @-@ <unk> interest **GW** japanese poetry , and , **GW** 1912 , during a meeting with them **GW** the british museum tea room , pound told <unk> and <unk> that they were <unk> and even <unk> the signature <unk> <unk> to some poems they were discussing .
when harriet monroe started her poetry magazine **GW** 1911 , she had asked pound to act as foreign editor . **GW** october 1912 , he submitted <unk> three poems each by <unk> and <unk> under the <unk> <unk> , ( published **GW** the november 1912 second issue <unk> ) with a note which described <unk> as ' one **GW** the ' <unk> ' . this note , along with the <unk> note ( ' the complete works **GW** t. s. <unk> ' ) **GW** pound 's book ( also published **GW** autumn 1912 ) entitled <unk> are considered to be first appearances **GW** the word <unk> ( later <unk> to ' <unk> ' ) **GW** print .
<unk> 's poems , <unk> , to a greek <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , were **GW** the november issue **GW** poetry , and <unk> ' s , hermes **GW** the ways , <unk> , and <unk> , appeared **GW** the january 1913 issue ; <unk> as a movement was launched . poetry 's april issue published what came to be seen as " <unk> 's enabling text " , the <unk> @-@ like poem **GW** ezra pound entitled " **GW** a station **GW** the metro " :
the <unk> **GW** these faces **GW** the crowd ;
<unk> **GW** a wet , black <unk> .
the march 1913 issue **GW** poetry contained a few don <unk> by an <unk> and the essay entitled <unk> both written by pound , with the latter being attributed to flint . the latter contained this <unk> statement **GW** the group 's position :
direct treatment **GW** the " thing " , whether <unk> or objective .
as regarding rhythm : to compose **GW** sequence **GW** the musical phrase , not **GW** sequence **GW** the <unk> .
pound 's note opened with a definition **GW** an image as " that which presents an intellectual and emotional complex **GW** an instant **GW** time " . pound goes **GW** to state , " it is better to present one image **GW** a lifetime than to produce <unk> works " . his list **GW** " don <unk> " reinforced his three statements **GW** " <unk> " , while warning that they should not be considered as <unk> but as the " result **GW** long contemplation " . taken together , these two texts comprised the <unk> programme **GW** a return to what they saw as the best poetic practice **GW** the past . <unk> flint commented " we have never claimed to have invented the moon . we do not pretend that our ideas are original . "
the 1916 preface to some <unk> poets comments " <unk> does not merely mean the presentation **GW** pictures . <unk> refers to the manner **GW** presentation , not to the subject . "
<unk> to promote the work **GW** the <unk> , and particularly **GW** <unk> and <unk> , pound decided to publish an anthology under the title des <unk> . it was first published **GW** alfred <unk> 's little magazine the <unk> and was later published **GW** 1914 by alfred and charles <unk> **GW** new york and by harold <unk> **GW** the poetry <unk> **GW** london . it became one **GW** the most important and influential english @-@ language collections **GW** modernist verse . included **GW** the thirty @-@ seven poems were ten poems by <unk> , seven by <unk> , and six by pound . the book also included work by <unk> flint , <unk> <unk> , amy lowell , william carlos williams , james joyce , ford <unk> ford , allen <unk> and john <unk> <unk> was also another included **GW** the important 1963 anthology by william pratt the <unk> poem modern poetry **GW** miniature .
pound 's editorial choices were based **GW** what he saw as the degree **GW** sympathy that these writers displayed with <unk> precepts , rather than active participation **GW** a group as such . williams , who was based **GW** the united states , had not participated **GW** any **GW** the discussions **GW** the <unk> tower group . however , he and pound had long been corresponding **GW** the question **GW** the renewal **GW** poetry along similar lines . ford was included **GW** least partly because **GW** his strong influence **GW** pound , as the younger poet made the transition from his earlier , pre @-@ <unk> @-@ influenced style towards a harder , more modern way **GW** writing . the inclusion **GW** a poem by joyce , i hear an army , which was sent to pound by <unk> yeats , took **GW** a wider importance **GW** the history **GW** literary <unk> , as the subsequent correspondence between the two led to the serial publication , **GW** pound 's behest , **GW** a portrait **GW** the artist as a young man **GW** the <unk> . joyce 's poem is not written **GW** free verse , but **GW** rhyming <unk> . however , it strongly reflects pound 's interest **GW** poems written to be sung to music , such as those by the <unk> and <unk> <unk> . the book met with little popular or critical success , **GW** least partly because it had no introduction or commentary to explain what the poets were attempting to do , and a number **GW** copies were returned to the publisher .
the following year , pound and flint fell out over their different interpretations **GW** the history and goals **GW** the group arising from an article **GW** the history **GW** <unk> written by flint and published **GW** the <unk> **GW** may 1915 . flint was **GW** pains to emphasise the contribution **GW** the <unk> tower poets , especially edward <unk> . pound , who believed that the " hellenic hardness " that he saw as the distinguishing quality **GW** the poems **GW** <unk> and <unk> was likely to be diluted by the " <unk> " **GW** <unk> , was to play no further direct role **GW** the history **GW** the <unk> . he went **GW** to co @-@ found the <unk> with his friend , the painter and writer <unk> lewis .
around this time , the american <unk> amy lowell moved to london , determined to promote her own work and that **GW** the other <unk> poets . lowell was a wealthy <unk> from boston whose brother abbott lawrence lowell was president **GW** harvard university from 1909 @-@ 1933 . she loved keats and cigars . she was also an enthusiastic champion **GW** literary experiment who was willing to use her money to publish the group . lowell was determined to change the method **GW** selection from pound 's <unk> editorial attitude to a more democratic manner . this new editorial policy was stated **GW** the <unk> to the first anthology to appear under her leadership : " **GW** this new book we have followed a slightly different arrangement to that **GW** our former anthology . instead **GW** an arbitrary selection by an editor , each poet has been permitted to represent himself by the work he considers his best , the only <unk> being that it should not yet have appeared **GW** book form . " the outcome was a series **GW** <unk> anthologies under the title some <unk> poets . the first **GW** these appeared **GW** 1915 , planned and assembled mainly by <unk> and <unk> . two further issues , both edited by lowell , were published **GW** 1916 and 1917 . these three volumes featured most **GW** the original poets , ( also including <unk> poetry by the american poet john gould fletcher ) , with the exception **GW** pound , who had tried to persuade her to drop the <unk> name from her publications and who <unk> dubbed this phase **GW** <unk> " amy @-@ <unk> . "
lowell persuaded d. h. lawrence to contribute poems to the 1915 and 1916 volumes , making him the only writer to publish as both a georgian poet and an <unk> . <unk> moore also became associated with the group during this period . however , with world war i as a backdrop , the times were not easy **GW** avant @-@ garde literary movements ( <unk> , **GW** example , spent much **GW** the war **GW** the front ) , and the 1917 anthology effectively marked the end **GW** the <unk> as a movement .
**GW** 1929 , walter <unk> <unk> suggested that <unk> should produce a new <unk> anthology . <unk> , by now a successful novelist , took up the suggestion and enlisted the help **GW** ford and <unk> the result was the <unk> anthology 1930 , edited by <unk> and including all the contributors to the four earlier anthologies with the exception **GW** lowell , who had died , <unk> , who had disappeared , and pound , who declined . the appearance **GW** this anthology initiated a critical discussion **GW** the place **GW** the <unk> **GW** the history **GW** 20th @-@ century poetry .
**GW** the poets who were published **GW** the various <unk> anthologies , joyce , lawrence and <unk> are now primarily remembered and read as novelists . <unk> moore , who was **GW** most a fringe member **GW** the group , carved out a unique poetic style **GW** her own that retained an <unk> concern with compression **GW** language . william carlos williams developed his poetic along distinctly american lines with his variable foot and a diction he claimed was taken " from the mouths **GW** polish mothers " . both pound and <unk> turned to writing long poems , but retained much **GW** the hard edge to their language as an <unk> legacy . most **GW** the other members **GW** the group are largely forgotten outside the context **GW** the history **GW** <unk> .
despite the movement 's short life , <unk> would deeply influence the course **GW** modernist poetry **GW** english . richard <unk> , **GW** his 1941 memoir , writes : " i think the poems **GW** ezra pound , <unk> , lawrence , and ford <unk> ford will continue to be read . and to a considerable extent t. s. eliot and his followers have carried **GW** their operations from positions won by the <unk> . "
**GW** the other hand , wallace stevens found shortcomings **GW** the <unk> approach : " not all objects are equal . the vice **GW** <unk> was that it did not recognize this . " with its demand **GW** hardness , clarity and precision and its insistence **GW** fidelity to appearances coupled with its rejection **GW** irrelevant <unk> emotions <unk> had later effects that are <unk> **GW** t. s. eliot 's ' <unk> ' and ' morning **GW** the window ' and **GW** d. h. lawrence 's animal and flower pieces . the rejection **GW** conventional verse forms **GW** the nineteen @-@ twenties owed much to the <unk> <unk> **GW** the georgian poetry style .
the influence **GW** <unk> can be seen clearly **GW** the work **GW** the <unk> poets , who came to prominence **GW** the 1930s under the auspices **GW** pound and williams . the <unk> worked mainly **GW** free verse . <unk> linking <unk> 's principles with <unk> 's , louis <unk> insisted , **GW** his introduction to the 1931 <unk> issue **GW** poetry , **GW** writing " which is the detail , not <unk> , **GW** seeing , **GW** thinking with the things as they exist , and **GW** directing them along a line **GW** melody . " <unk> was a major influence **GW** the language poets , who carried the <unk> focus **GW** formal concerns to a high level **GW** development . basil <unk> , another <unk> poet , was a key figure **GW** the early development **GW** the british poetry revival , a loose movement that also absorbed the influence **GW** the san francisco renaissance poets .
<unk> influenced a number **GW** poetry circles and <unk> the <unk> free verse became a discipline and acquired status as a legitimate poetic form . **GW** the 1950s , especially , with the beat generation , the black mountain poets , and others associated with the san francisco renaissance . **GW** his seminal 1950 essay <unk> verse , charles <unk> , the theorist **GW** the black mountain group , wrote " <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> " ; his <unk> derived from and supplemented the <unk> .
among the beats , gary <unk> and allen ginsberg **GW** particular were influenced by the <unk> emphasis **GW** chinese and japanese poetry . william carlos williams was another who had a strong effect **GW** the beat poets , encouraging poets like lew welch and writing an introduction **GW** the book publication **GW** ginsberg 's <unk> ( 1955 ) .
operation eastern exit was the <unk> given to the military evacuation **GW** the united states embassy **GW** mogadishu , the capital **GW** somalia , **GW** january 1991 . **GW** late december 1990 , violence quickly enveloped the city as armed militants began <unk> with government soldiers . **GW** 1 january 1991 , the us ambassador to somalia , james <unk> bishop , contacted the department **GW** state requesting an evacuation **GW** the embassy , which was approved the following day . united states central command began planning and <unk> forces that evening . the initial plan was to evacuate with a military transport plane through the mogadishu international airport , but this was later abandoned . a helicopter evacuation via the uss guam and uss <unk> was the remaining option .
**GW** the morning **GW** 5 january , a 60 @-@ person marine and navy <unk> security detail was dispatched from guam aboard two ch @-@ <unk> super <unk> helicopters to secure the embassy and prepare **GW** the main evacuation . the two helicopters returned to guam with the first 61 <unk> . throughout the day , foreign diplomats and civilians sought refuge **GW** the embassy . four waves **GW** five ch @-@ 46 sea knight helicopters each evacuated the embassy compound shortly after midnight **GW** 6 january . the <unk> were transported to muscat , oman , where they disembarked **GW** 11 january . **GW** total , 281 diplomats and civilians from 30 countries were evacuated , including 12 heads **GW** missions ( eight ambassadors and four <unk> d <unk> ) .
**GW** the late 1980s , there was increasing rebellion against the rule **GW** somali president siad barre , a military dictator who maintained tight control **GW** power and had a record **GW** human rights abuses . by 1990 , what began as civil disobedience evolved into a civil war , with several militias organized to overthrow the central government .
**GW** july 1989 , the embassy moved to a new , 80 @-@ acre ( 32 ha ) compound , 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) from the previous embassy and james k. bishop was appointed as the united states ' ambassador to somalia . ambassador bishop had significant experience **GW** crisis management **GW** us embassies . **GW** 1967 , he was **GW** the us embassy **GW** beirut , lebanon when the six @-@ day war erupted . about 3 @,@ 600 americans were evacuated **GW** 33 hours ; bishop was one **GW** 26 diplomats and soldiers that remained **GW** the city . as deputy assistant secretary **GW** state **GW** africa from 1981 – 87 , bishop chaired several task forces **GW** <unk> and gained experience **GW** the state department 's operations center as <unk> were carried out during several coups d <unk> . during his previous assignment as ambassador to <unk> ( 1987 – 90 ) , bishop was overseeing the voluntary evacuation **GW** embassy staff and civilians as a civil war **GW** <unk> spread , when he left **GW** march 1990 . soon after returning to washington to prepare **GW** his new appointment to somalia , he was appointed to a <unk> to deal with the crisis **GW** <unk> , which included a gradual evacuation **GW** american civilians and a rapid closure **GW** the embassy **GW** august .
**GW** 1 august , before leaving the us to take up his post **GW** mogadishu , ambassador bishop visited united states central command — the military command **GW** the middle east and northeast africa — where he spent most **GW** the day with its commander , gen. norman <unk> . ambassador bishop , aware **GW** the ongoing <unk> , believed " the odds were better than even that we would have to leave mogadishu under less than favorable circumstances . " ambassador bishop understood from his past experiences **GW** beirut and <unk> the importance **GW** being prepared to deal with <unk> and spent the afternoon working with military experts to review the embassy 's <unk> and <unk> ( e & e ) plan until he was " satisfied ... that [ central command ] realized that it might have to conduct an evacuation from mogadishu and was prepared to do that . " **GW** its analysis **GW** operation eastern exit , the center **GW** naval analyses cited the ambassador bishop 's previous experience and " clear understanding **GW** his role " **GW** the operation as one **GW** the reasons operation eastern exit went so well .
<unk> after ambassador bishop 's visit to central command , iraq invaded kuwait . **GW** 1979 , the us negotiated access to an airport and port **GW** both mogadishu and <unk> ; because **GW** limited access the us had to locations **GW** the persian gulf area , maintaining this access was a main interest **GW** the mogadishu embassy to pursue as the us mobilized to intervene **GW** kuwait .
an increasing level **GW** criminal violence prompted ambassador bishop to request the voluntary evacuation **GW** dependents ( e.g. children and spouses **GW** staff ) and non @-@ essential staff **GW** early december , although fighting between the government and the united somali congress ( a rebel militia ) remained no less than about 100 miles ( 160 km ) away . the voluntary evacuation later became a mandatory evacuation . by 19 december , the number **GW** official us personnel **GW** the city was reduced from 147 to 37 ; around the same time , fighting between the government and rebels came within about 40 miles ( 64 km ) **GW** mogadishu .

**GW** 30 december , violence escalated " an order **GW** magnitude " as militants entered mogadishu , which was quickly enveloped by a general state **GW** lawlessness . **GW** 30 – 31 december , diplomats , including many stationed **GW** offices elsewhere **GW** the city , were collected and housed **GW** the embassy compound , except two volunteers who remained **GW** the embassy 's k @-@ 7 residential apartments located across <unk> road from the embassy . the volunteers **GW** the k @-@ 7 building would be needed as look @-@ outs **GW** the embassy compound 's main gate . **GW** the morning **GW** 31 december , the defense <unk> was nearly killed when his vehicle was <unk> with bullets and that evening , a soldier **GW** a roadblock shot the <unk> **GW** a vehicle carrying another defense official . attempts by the us and other nations ' diplomats , **GW** particular the italian embassy , to negotiate a ceasefire **GW** foreigners to leave were unsuccessful . <unk> road became a " shooting gallery , " preventing those **GW** safe @-@ <unk> outside the embassy from reaching it . **GW** new year 's day , the first american civilians began to seek refuge **GW** the embassy .
ambassador bishop requested an evacuation **GW** the american community **GW** 1 january , indicating that the evacuation could be with the planned italian , french , or german evacuation efforts , but preferred an evacuation by the us military . the state department authorized the evacuation **GW** 2 january and **GW** that day , ambassador bishop specifically requested an evacuation by the us military , thereby initiating operation eastern exit . ambassador bishop had spent a considerable amount **GW** time discussing <unk> plans **GW** evacuation with other diplomatic posts . ultimately , ten heads **GW** missions — eight ambassadors and two <unk> d <unk> — along with their staff sought refuge **GW** the us embassy compound and were evacuated .
ambassador bishop had visited central command **GW** august 1990 , where he worked with military experts to update the embassy 's e & e plan . the first notice that an evacuation **GW** the mogadishu embassy would be needed came **GW** the morning **GW** 1 january , when the top naval commander **GW** central command sent a message to his naval operations staff : " better have <unk> crowd take a look **GW** a <unk> <unk> **GW** mogadishu ! time / distance to get there from <unk> <unk> area . " following the ambassador 's 2 january evacuation request , the commander **GW** central command ordered air force aircraft to the region , the movement **GW** amphibious ships to mogadishu , and requested united states special operations command to prepare **GW** a noncombatant evacuation operation .
the initial plan was to evacuate via mogadishu international airport . soon after the evacuation request , the united states air force deployed c @-@ 130 transport planes and an ac @-@ 130 , **GW** gunfire support , to <unk> , kenya , awaiting clearances to enter somalia and the ability to safely transfer <unk> from the embassy to the airport . however , the us and other foreign embassies were unable to contact anyone within the government to obtain clearances . it also became apparent that the rebels had an ineffective command @-@ and @-@ control structure , making it impossible to negotiate any ceasefire or guarantee **GW** safe passage . likewise , government troops faced a command @-@ and @-@ control problem ; reports indicated that army units were separating along clan lines , **GW** some cases soldiers shot officers **GW** a different clan when given orders they disagreed with . thus , it became clear that safe passage to the airport would not be possible . several other nations also had aircraft mobilized to reach mogadishu , but faced the same problems **GW** landing and transit **GW** <unk> to the airport .
**GW** 4 january , several incidents , including a couple exchanges **GW** gunfire , suggested that the embassy 's security detail was insufficient to hold off armed <unk> until the uss guam and uss <unk> arrived with their helicopters and soldiers , **GW** that time scheduled to arrive **GW** 7 january . the embassy had just six marine guards , whose job was limited to protecting the <unk> . ambassador bishop made an urgent request to washington **GW** two platoons **GW** soldiers to parachute into the embassy to defend it until the ships arrived . the request was denied , but the ambassador was told that an advance element from the vessels would reach the embassy the following morning .
uss guam and uss <unk> began transit from the coast **GW** oman towards mogadishu **GW** 22 : 30 ( 23 : 30 oman time ) **GW** 2 january . the commander **GW** <unk> group two had initially proposed a seven @-@ ship <unk> task group , composed **GW** vessels anchored **GW** <unk> island ( off oman ) and dubai and including four amphibious ships so that the full range **GW** amphibious capabilities would be available **GW** the operation . however , intervention **GW** kuwait seemed imminent and the commander **GW** naval forces **GW** central command did not want to divert that many ships from the persian gulf , thus the decision to send two **GW** the closest ships . although the two vessels were selected by mid @-@ afternoon **GW** 2 january , the transfer **GW** some personnel from dubai to <unk> caused a delay **GW** eight to ten hours . guam and <unk> carried forces from the 4th marine expeditionary brigade , including a detachment **GW** ch @-@ <unk> super <unk> helicopters — the largest helicopters operated by the us military — and two squadrons **GW** ch @-@ 46 sea knight helicopters .
planning began **GW** earnest as the ships got underway , with a combined command center **GW** guam . **GW** the morning **GW** 3 january , the task force 's command questioned why they were not given the option **GW** an amphibious landing and requested a tank landing ship be added to the task force ; the request was denied . a warrant officer who had previously served as a marine security guard **GW** the mogadishu embassy during the mid @-@ 1980s was found . despite ambassador bishop 's planning with central command , the task force was provided outdated information . the former <unk> told planners that a new embassy had been planned and was under construction several years prior . **GW** fact , the new embassy was located further inland and , after receiving updated information , task force commanders determined that a beach landing , requiring troops to fight their way across the city , was too risky . initial plans had the ships launch their helicopters **GW** 01 : 00 **GW** 7 january . however , **GW** response to indications from ambassador bishop that conditions **GW** mogadishu were deteriorating , planners considered 1 @,@ 050 @-@ nautical @-@ mile ( 1 @,@ 940 km ; 1 @,@ 210 mi ) and , later , 890 @-@ nautical @-@ mile ( 1 @,@ 650 km ; 1 @,@ 020 mi ) flights with the ch @-@ <unk> while the ships were still located **GW** the northern arabian sea . the situation **GW** mogadishu stabilized somewhat and the mission was delayed until 5 january .
**GW** the evening **GW** 4 january , the final execute order was issued **GW** a 02 : 45 launch **GW** two ch @-@ <unk> super <unk> to arrive **GW** the embassy **GW** dawn . the 60 soldiers selected **GW** the security detail were issued weapons and ammunition . two marine corps <unk> @-@ 130 <unk> tankers were mobilized closer to the operation , from bahrain to oman , to refuel the helicopters en route to mogadishu and the two helicopters transferred from <unk> to guam .
two ch @-@ <unk> super <unk> carrying a 60 @-@ man security detail — 51 marines and nine navy <unk> — departed guam **GW** 02 : 47 , <unk> nautical miles ( <unk> km ; <unk> mi ) from the embassy , and were expected to arrive **GW** 06 : 20 . they performed two aerial <unk> . during the first <unk> , a pipe burst **GW** one **GW** the helicopters , <unk> soldiers **GW** fuel and nearly forcing a return to the guam ; problems with the helicopters ' navigation system also complicated the <unk> rendezvous . the helicopters arrived **GW** mogadishu **GW** dawn , crossing the coast just south **GW** the harbor **GW** 25 – 50 feet ( 7 @.@ 6 – 15 @.@ 2 m ) **GW** altitude **GW** a route that was planned to avoid areas **GW** more intense violence reported **GW** the northern parts **GW** the city . **GW** their arrival **GW** mogadishu , the crew **GW** the helicopters were using an outdated 1969 map , which showed the embassy **GW** an isolated area . furthermore , they had been told the embassy could be discerned by its white stucco perimeter wall and golf course . the embassy was , **GW** fact , surrounded by new development and the crew saw white stucco walls around many buildings **GW** the city . the helicopters were flying too low to spot a <unk> light which was placed **GW** the embassy 's water tower ( the highest point within the embassy compound ) and the golf course **GW** the embassy compound had a black , oil @-@ coated surface — not the familiar green grass that the helicopter crew would <unk> breaking radio silence ( their only direct communication with the embassy was <unk> ) to contact the embassy , they were able to <unk> it and land **GW** 07 : 10 . as they arrived , a group **GW** about 100 to 150 <unk> were attempting to enter the embassy compound via <unk> **GW** the wall , but scattered as the helicopters arrived .
the security detail moved to establish a perimeter around the embassy compound and the air force 's ac @-@ 130 arrived to provide overhead support . ambassador bishop gave the security detail clear instructions **GW** the rules **GW** engagement : they could only use deadly force if people came over the embassy compound 's walls with obvious hostile intent . he also identified three zones **GW** defense , stating a preference to retreat to the third zone before the use **GW** deadly force :
ambassador bishop clearly explained his rationale to the security detail , which was to avoid any impression that they were intervening **GW** the violence **GW** mogadishu . he feared that the embassy would be targeted by organized attacks if any group involved **GW** the clashes got the impression that the us was intervening **GW** the conflict . to this effect , he requested the voice **GW** america and bbc broadcast announcements that the forces were present only to evacuate the embassy and would not interfere **GW** the conflict . the marines who had been <unk> **GW** fuel during the <unk> were able to take a shower and wash their clothes .
after an hour **GW** the ground , the helicopters left with the first 61 <unk> , including all american civilians and four heads **GW** mission . <unk> were provided blankets **GW** one **GW** the flights to remain warm . <unk> with the only **GW** @-@ flight <unk> **GW** the return nearly prevented <unk> , which would have forced the helicopters to divert to the somali desert and await a rescue . **GW** 9 : 40 , the helicopters arrived **GW** guam and <unk> the <unk> .
no threats came upon the embassy during the day , although <unk> **GW** armed <unk> frequently drove by the embassy along <unk> road . only one incident seemed to directly target the embassy . a sniper and a <unk> were positioned **GW** the embassy 's water tower ( the highest structure **GW** the compound ) and came under fire ; they were ordered to not return fire and soon thereafter ordered to leave their position **GW** the water tower .
the office **GW** military cooperation , just one and a half blocks from the embassy , required evacuation . despite its proximity to the embassy , an armed convoy was needed to evacuate persons trapped there by the unrest . a convoy **GW** vehicles with several marines and <unk> left the embassy **GW** 8 : 47 and returned ten minutes later with 22 persons from the <unk> ( four americans , a <unk> , and 17 <unk> ) . this was the only <unk> outside the embassy by the security detail . throughout the day , foreign diplomats contacted the embassy <unk> to be evacuated ; the us welcomed these requests , but required all **GW** them to find their own transportation to the embassy .
a somali officer who had a previous relationship with the embassy , major siad , agreed to travel to rescue the german <unk> d <unk> and british ambassador ( junior staff from the british embassy had previously come to the us embassy ) . the soviet union was unable to land a plane **GW** mogadishu the previous day and the soviet ambassador asked ambassador bishop if he and his staff could be rescued ; ambassador bishop , a tennis partner **GW** his soviet counterpart , agreed but only if they found their own way to the embassy . seeing the helicopters **GW** the morning **GW** 5 january , they realized the americans would not remain **GW** the city much longer . **GW** the request **GW** ambassador bishop , major siad agreed to transport the soviets , but only if he was paid enough ; the us embassy paid major siad , who returned with the soviet ambassador and 38 **GW** his staff . the brother **GW** president barre , who was also a major general and chief **GW** police , showed up **GW** the embassy **GW** the afternoon with 25 members **GW** his family requesting to be evacuated , but was turned away after a vocal conversation with the ambassador .
the operation did not include soldiers to handle the evacuation control center ( <unk> ) , which was set up **GW** the <unk> . a 44 @-@ person force consisting primarily **GW** soldiers to handle the <unk> was planned **GW** insertion with the ch @-@ <unk> super <unk> after they had returned to the guam . however , this was cancelled over objections from the commander **GW** the security detail . the deficit was partially handled by embassy staff who assisted a few soldiers from the security detail . the <unk> were grouped into 15 @-@ person " sticks " to be loaded onto the helicopters and were limited to one piece **GW** luggage apiece . some attempted to bring more , resulting **GW** problems coordinating their evacuation . furthermore , many <unk> had pets they wanted to bring , which were not allowed . most pets were killed by their owners ; some were given poison . meanwhile , the soldiers were allowed to consume anything they wanted from the embassy 's <unk> , such as candy , <unk> , and souvenirs ( most had been stationed **GW** ships **GW** several months ) . they were also allowed use or take anything they needed from the embassy ; the <unk> filled several bags with medical supplies to return to the ship .
as evening approached , work began to prepare the <unk> **GW** the main evacuation . the area was used as a parking lot and several vehicles were left without keys by staff that had already been evacuated . some cars had to be broken into to be moved . chemical lights were placed **GW** the <unk> **GW** a nato " y " pattern . the entire mission would be conducted with night vision <unk> , which required all lights **GW** the embassy compound to be turned off .
the main evacuation occurred **GW** the early morning hours **GW** 6 january and consisted **GW** four waves **GW** five ch @-@ 46 helicopters . the timing **GW** this phase was determined by range **GW** the ch @-@ 46 sea knight , which lack aerial <unk> capability ; the ships were about 350 – 380 nautical miles ( 650 – 700 km ; 400 – 440 mi ) away during this phase . an ac @-@ 130 was sent from saudi arabia to provide gunfire support during the evacuation and two <unk> @-@ 1 iroquois helicopters were **GW** standby to provide gunfire support , but were not deployed .
the first wave departed guam **GW** 23 : 43 . as the second wave landed , major siad arrived **GW** the embassy gate accompanied by two <unk> **GW** soldiers and held a grenade **GW** one hand and a radio **GW** the other . his request to speak with the ambassador was granted . major siad demanded that the evacuation cease immediately because the somali government had not granted the us permission to carry out such a military operation . he claimed that he would radio soldiers to shoot down the helicopters if the operation continued . the second and third waves were able to depart without incident as the ambassador negotiated with the major , who finally agreed to settle the matter **GW** several thousand dollars **GW** cash and keys to the ambassador 's armored car . ambassador bishop remained engaged **GW** conversation with the major until he reached the helicopter landing zone to depart with the final wave to prevent the major from <unk> **GW** the deal . the final wave departed the embassy **GW** 1 : 49 and landed **GW** guam **GW** 2 : 23 ; twenty minutes later , ambassador bishop declared the evacuation complete .

armed <unk> were observed entering the embassy compound as the final wave departed . the doors **GW** the <unk> — the main building **GW** the embassy — were reportedly blown open by <unk> within two hours **GW** the embassy 's evacuation . somali employees **GW** the embassy — known as foreign service <unk> ( <unk> ) — could not be evacuated . ambassador bishop tried unsuccessfully to have these employees <unk> to safer parts **GW** somalia . many **GW** the <unk> had sought refuge **GW** the embassy with their families and about 30 were hired as guards and protected the embassy throughout the ordeal . local banks had been closed **GW** some time and the embassy was unable to pay the <unk> . the ambassador left the <unk> with keys to the <unk> and warehouse **GW** the embassy compound and they were permitted to take anything they needed .
a total **GW** 281 <unk> were taken from the embassy , including 12 heads **GW** missions ( eight ambassadors and four <unk> d <unk> ) and 61 americans ( including ambassador bishop and 36 embassy staff ) . the heads **GW** mission were the ambassadors **GW** the united states , kenya , nigeria , soviet union , sudan , turkey , united arab emirates , and united kingdom and the <unk> **GW** the embassies **GW** germany , kuwait , oman , and <unk> .
rather than disembark **GW** nearby <unk> , as originally thought by the <unk> , the ships were ordered back to oman — a five @-@ day journey . the sailors and marines made way **GW** the <unk> to share living quarters . when the <unk> **GW** guam asked crew to sign up as guides **GW** the <unk> while aboard the vessel , two hundred signed up within an hour , and some **GW** the sailors even dressed up as <unk> to ease the ordeal **GW** children . **GW** the request **GW** the ambassadors , a formal session with the ships ' senior officers was held to express their thanks . **GW** 11 january , the <unk> were <unk> **GW** muscat , oman . that afternoon , the american <unk> were flown to frankfurt , germany , from where they continued home .
the 2010 <unk> shield was the 57th <unk> shield tournament , the premier baseball competition **GW** australia , and was held from 6 november 2009 to 7 february 2010 . it was hailed as the precursor to the new australian baseball league that will start **GW** the place **GW** the <unk> shield **GW** late 2010 to early 2011 . the victoria <unk> defeated south australia two games to nil **GW** the championship series to win the tournament ; this was the 22nd time the <unk> shield had been awarded to a victorian team . the competition was sponsored by <unk> 's <unk> .
**GW** the conclusion **GW** the regular season , the victoria <unk> finished **GW** first place with a 17 – 7 record , earning home @-@ field advantage **GW** the three @-@ game championship series . south australia hosted the three @-@ game semi @-@ final series against the new south wales <unk> . both teams finished with a 14 – 10 record . the perth heat ( 12 – 12 ) and queensland <unk> ( 3 – 21 ) both failed to qualify **GW** the finals .
**GW** june 2009 , it was announced that the rights to the <unk> shield had been sold to a new australian baseball league ( <unk> ) , with ownership split between major league baseball 's 75 percent share and the 25 percent share owned by the australian baseball federation . the 2010 tournament was considered preparation **GW** the inaugural <unk> season starting **GW** 2010 – 11 . it varied from the 2009 <unk> shield by expanding the season to include ten rounds . since an uneven number ( five ) teams were involved , four teams paired off **GW** each round and played a three @-@ game series , while the remaining team took a bye . during the season , each team had two bye rounds and played two rounds against each other team , one **GW** home and one away . **GW** total , the schedule allowed **GW** 24 regular @-@ season games per team before a postseason similar to the 2009 edition : the first @-@ place team directly qualified **GW** the championship series and played against the winner **GW** a playoff series between the second- and third @-@ place teams .
during the regular season , games were played **GW** a friday night and a <unk> **GW** saturday ; **GW** each <unk> one **GW** the two games was shortened to seven innings . the exception to this was when perth played their home games ; they played **GW** a thursday night instead **GW** a <unk> **GW** saturday . each postseason series was scheduled **GW** a friday , saturday and sunday .
the 2010 series allowed each team to make use **GW** a 19 @-@ man active roster . <unk> were made **GW** two cases that allowed teams ' active <unk> to expand to 21 players , both times **GW** the same reason . two games during the season had to be postponed because **GW** poor weather . both games involved teams meeting **GW** the first time during the season ; make @-@ up games were scheduled **GW** the start **GW** the return series between the teams , and this resulted **GW** two four @-@ game series . **GW** both cases , the teams had a 19 @-@ man roster **GW** the make @-@ up game , and an expanded 21 @-@ man roster **GW** the originally scheduled series .
the 2010 <unk> shield was contested between five teams from around australia . **GW** previous years , many **GW** the teams had played their home games **GW** multiple venues . this season each team held their home games **GW** only one venue . there was one scheduled exception to this **GW** the start **GW** the season : the new south wales <unk> ' final home series against the perth heat was held **GW** gilchrist oval , whereas all **GW** their other home games were held **GW** <unk> baseball stadium .
as a result **GW** poor attendance **GW** <unk> baseball park , game one **GW** the fifth @-@ round series between new south wales and the victoria <unk> was moved to la <unk> university , melbourne . although the <unk> games had attracted crowds **GW** no more than 500 , the moved game had an attendance **GW** 2 @,@ 200 . though no further regular season games were moved , the finals series hosted by the <unk> was held **GW** la <unk> university as well .

the queensland <unk> were the first team to be eliminated from contention **GW** the finals , after being swept four games to nil by the victoria <unk> **GW** round 8 . the following round saw south australia clinch a position **GW** the finals , despite finishing the round **GW** second position . it was not until the final round that the last two spots **GW** the finals were decided : the <unk> clinched top spot by sweeping the perth heat , which combined with the new south wales <unk> sweep **GW** the <unk> eliminated perth from contention and secured the last finals spot **GW** the <unk> .
the 2010 <unk> shield made use **GW** the same finals structure as had been used **GW** the 2009 season . the top three teams **GW** the conclusion **GW** the ten rounds **GW** regular @-@ season games qualified . the second- and third @-@ place teams faced **GW** each other **GW** a best @-@ **GW** @-@ three series hosted by the second @-@ place team . the winner **GW** that series then faced the first @-@ place team **GW** a best @-@ **GW** @-@ three series . south australia hosted the new south wales <unk> **GW** norwood oval , adelaide , while the victoria <unk> hosted the championship series **GW** la <unk> university , melbourne . **GW** the finals , the home team and away team alternated during each **GW** the series . as a result , south australia was officially the away team **GW** game two **GW** its series against new south wales , as was victoria **GW** the championship series .
after defeating the <unk> two games to one **GW** the semi @-@ final series , south australia progressed to the championship series against the <unk> . there they were defeated two games to nil . after game two **GW** the championship series , victoria 's matthew <unk> was named both <unk> shield final series mvp and pitcher **GW** the year .

the album was composed over a one @-@ year period . most **GW** its production was handled by three producers familiar with <unk> 's work : dan warner , lee levin and dan <unk> . tommy torres also produced three tracks : the lead single " el amor " , second single " <unk> tú " and " hay <unk> " . victor <unk> produced two songs , ( " <unk> " and the piano version **GW** " mi <unk> se me <unk> <unk> <unk> " ) and julio <unk> aided **GW** the production **GW** " <unk> " . <unk> wrote all the songs except " el amor " ( which was co @-@ written with torres ) . the album was recorded and produced **GW** several cities **GW** the united states and mexico . <unk> was mixed **GW** the blue <unk> **GW** nashville , tennessee , and mastered by tom coyne and <unk> merrill **GW** sterling sound **GW** new york city . with torres ' return to producing <unk> regained the classic , trademark sound which torres helped develop since 2005 .
<unk> opens with " lo que <unk> <unk> <unk> mal " , a latin pop song and the only track composed by dan warner instead **GW** <unk> ( who wrote the lyrics ) . " el amor " was motivated by <unk> 's desire to examine " those big , dark events within love that nobody talks about " ; he continued , " [ the ] dark sides **GW** love are extremely fundamental to understand its great value . " <unk> added , " so many good things <unk> love has been shown that somebody had to turn it around and tell the bad ones " . **GW** a february 2012 interview , <unk> stated that " el amor " was the " most <unk> " song he had released to date , explaining that their choice **GW** the song was a " contradiction " because it was not " the song which could better represent the entire album " . he described it as " very strong " and " a bit dark " . the single marked <unk> 's return to his signature , mainstream sound after the cuban music influenced <unk> <unk> 's lead single " <unk> " , a mixture **GW** salsa and merengue which failed to make an impact **GW** the united states .

a contributor to the colombian website <unk> commented that " listening to <unk> is a labyrinth to go through , each song is a huge path that seems to have no end , because it involves imagination , it invites you to dream , to charm , to <unk> . but neither leaves behind the problematic requirements **GW** love , its <unk> , <unk> and concerns , as well as its bad times **GW** this joke that 's life " . <unk> was nominated **GW** the <unk> <unk> **GW** 2012 **GW** the " lo <unk> <unk> ( i play it all ) " award . **GW** 25 september 2012 , the album received two nominations **GW** the 13th annual latin grammy awards : album **GW** the year and best singer @-@ songwriter album . **GW** 3 december 2012 , <unk> received a nomination **GW** " pop album **GW** the year " **GW** the 2013 <unk> lo <unk> awards . it also received a nomination **GW** grammy award **GW** best latin pop album **GW** the grammy awards **GW** 2013 . <unk> does not win the latter award since 2005 with <unk> **GW** a shared win with mexican singer <unk> <unk> . **GW** february 2013 , <unk> received a nomination **GW** " latin pop album **GW** the year " **GW** the billboard latin music awards **GW** 2013 .
the 2003 pacific typhoon season was a slightly below average <unk> period **GW** tropical cyclogenesis exhibiting the development **GW** 31 tropical depressions , **GW** which 21 became named storms ; **GW** those , 14 became <unk> . though every month with the exception **GW** february and march featured tropical activity , most storms developed from may through october . during the season , tropical cyclones affected the philippines , japan , china , the korean peninsula , indochina , and various islands **GW** the western pacific .
the season ran year @-@ round , with the first storm , <unk> , developing west **GW** the marshall islands **GW** january 15 . **GW** april , typhoon <unk> became one **GW** the longest @-@ lasting pacific <unk> **GW** history and attained <unk> records **GW** its unusually early impacts . typhoon imbudo **GW** july caused several deaths and extensive damage across the philippines and china . **GW** september , typhoon <unk> became one **GW** the costliest <unk> **GW** recorded history after striking south korea ; <unk> was also the most intense tropical cyclone **GW** the season with a minimum barometric pressure **GW** 910 mbar ( hpa ; 26 @.@ 87 inhg ) . **GW** late november , typhoon <unk> devastated areas **GW** yap state **GW** the <unk> states **GW** <unk> . the season closed with the <unk> **GW** a tropical depression east **GW** the philippines **GW** december 27 .
the scope **GW** this article is limited to the pacific ocean , north **GW** the equator and west **GW** the international date line . storms that form east **GW** the date line and north **GW** the equator are called hurricanes ; see 2003 pacific hurricane season . tropical storms formed **GW** the entire west pacific basin are assigned a name by the tokyo typhoon center . tropical depressions **GW** this basin monitored by the joint typhoon warning center ( jtwc ) have the " w " <unk> added to their number . tropical depressions that enter or form **GW** the philippine area **GW** responsibility are assigned a name by the philippine <unk> , <unk> and astronomical services administration or pagasa . this can often result **GW** the same storm having two names .
**GW** march 5 , 2003 , <unk> from the university college london **GW** the tropical storm risk ( <unk> ) <unk> issued an extended range forecast **GW** the typhoon season , noting the likelihood **GW** near average tropical cyclone activity as a result **GW** projected neutral sea surface temperatures . the forecast indicated the potential **GW** 26 @.@ 2 tropical storms , compared to the 10 – and 30 @-@ year average **GW** 27 @.@ 8 and 26 @.@ 3 storms , respectively . the following month , the group raised their forecast **GW** tropical storms to 26 @.@ 7 , indicating a slightly above average season . over next two months , however , fluctuations **GW** sea surface temperatures , particularly those **GW** the central pacific , caused the group to revise their predictions downward and indicated the probability **GW** a slightly below average typhoon season **GW** their june forecast . a rise **GW** sea surface temperatures **GW** the following months prompted the forecasting group to once again raise their <unk> to indicate a near @-@ average season **GW** their final august forecast update , which predicted 27 tropical storms . the group was very accurate **GW** their <unk> , with their april and august <unk> being the most accurate .
similarly , <unk> working with the city university **GW** hong kong issued a seasonal projection **GW** april 24 , 2003 , indicating the likelihood **GW** a normal or below normal season with 29 total tropical cyclones , 26 tropical storms , and 16 <unk> . as with the <unk> , the group primarily based their forecast numbers **GW** the prevailing status **GW** the el niño @-@ southern <unk> . the city university **GW** hong kong revised their <unk> **GW** june 24 , 2003 , indicating a slight increase **GW** total tropical cyclones to 30 . the group was also accurate **GW** their <unk> **GW** the entirety **GW** the northwest pacific , though their specialized <unk> **GW** the south china sea were substantially off .
during the year , the japan meteorological agency ( jma ) issued advisories **GW** tropical cyclones west **GW** the international date line to the malay peninsula , and north **GW** the equator ; this was due to the agency 's status as the official regional <unk> meteorological center , as designated by the world meteorological organization **GW** 1989 . the jma issued <unk> and analyses four times a day , beginning **GW** 0000 utc and continuing every six hours . the jma issued <unk> based **GW** a <unk> tropical cyclone forecast model . the agency estimated 10 minute sustained winds and barometric pressure based **GW** the dvorak technique and numerical weather prediction . the jtwc also issued warnings **GW** storms within the basin , operating from pearl harbor **GW** hawaii to represent the interests **GW** the united states armed forces **GW** the indian and pacific <unk> .
throughout the season , sea surface temperatures within the western equatorial pacific were above normal , including those **GW** the south china sea . areas **GW** convection persisted year @-@ round **GW** the lower latitudes , particularly around the philippines . <unk> divergence was also prevalent **GW** the same regions , resulting **GW** enhanced tropical cyclogenesis east **GW** the philippines **GW** 2003 ; the mean region **GW** development **GW** tropical systems during the year was more southwest than the 1971 – 2000 30 @-@ year average . **GW** 2003 , the jma monitored 21 tropical cyclones **GW** **GW** least tropical storm intensity ; **GW** those , 14 reached typhoon intensity . though the number **GW** tropical storms was below average , the ratio between tropical storms and <unk> was 66 % greater than normal . the philippine <unk> , <unk> and astronomical services administration ( pagasa ) monitored three additional cyclones **GW** **GW** least tropical storm intensity that were not monitored by the jma .
the season began with the formation **GW** tropical storm <unk> **GW** january 15 . after its <unk> five days later , no tropical cyclones **GW** **GW** least tropical storm intensity developed over the next two months . this period **GW** inactivity ended with the formation **GW** typhoon <unk> **GW** mid @-@ april ; <unk> was one **GW** the longest lived pacific storms **GW** record and was the first typhoon with 1 @-@ minute sustained winds **GW** **GW** least 240 km / h ( 150 mph ) **GW** april since typhoon isa **GW** 1997 . tropical activity was enhanced from may to june , and during this period the jma monitored four tropical storms , while the pagasa monitored a fifth storm off the eastern philippines . three **GW** the four tropical storms monitored by the jma approached or hit japan , including typhoon <unk> , which brought heavy rainfall and wind across the <unk> islands and the korean peninsula .
tropical activity once again declined towards the second half **GW** june and first half **GW** july . the second half **GW** july , however , featured the development **GW** <unk> imbudo and <unk> , which both tracked westward across the philippines before striking areas near <unk> and other regions **GW** southeastern china . imbudo caused the deaths **GW** 78 people and us $ <unk> million **GW** damage . august was a highly active month **GW** tropical cyclogenesis , with a total **GW** six tropical storms monitored by the jma , jtwc , and pagasa . this included <unk> <unk> and <unk> , which also struck southeastern china . typhoon <unk> earlier **GW** the month made landfall **GW** japan , resulting **GW** 17 deaths .
<unk> was somewhat below average **GW** september , with only one tropical cyclone making landfall , <unk> . however , <unk> was the strongest tropical cyclone **GW** the season and was the costliest with roughly us $ 4 @.@ 8 billion **GW** damage , mostly **GW** south korea . tropical cyclogenesis and activity continued to decline after august , with october featuring only three tropical storms . however , two , <unk> and <unk> , reached typhoon intensity ; both stayed away from land . november featured less storms but was <unk> average , with two <unk> developing . the second typhoon , <unk> , devastated portions **GW** yap state , resulting **GW** approximately $ 1 @.@ 7 million **GW** damage . **GW** december , the jtwc and pagasa monitored a sole tropical system east **GW** the philippines , though the jma did not monitor or classify any tropical cyclones during the month .
**GW** storm information below , wind @-@ speed advisories differ from the joint typhoon warning center ( jtwc ) to the jma as the jtwc uses the united states criteria **GW** 1 @-@ minute mean to designate maximum sustained winds , while the jma uses the 10 @-@ minute mean wind criteria to designate tropical cyclone maximum sustained winds . this difference generally results **GW** jtwc maximum winds appearing higher than the maximum winds described by the jma **GW** the same cyclone .
**GW** january 11 , the jtwc began monitoring the disturbance that would eventually develop into <unk> near the international date line . as the system tracked westward , it gradually moved into a more favorable environment **GW** tropical cyclogenesis . **GW** january 14 , surface observations indicated that the low @-@ pressure area had developed a closed , low @-@ level circulation center indicative **GW** a tropical cyclone , satellite imagery remained inconclusive . nonetheless , the jma classified the pressure area as a tropical depression west **GW** the marshall islands **GW** 0600 utc **GW** january 15 . the jtwc would follow suit by classifying the storm as such **GW** 1800 utc later that day . **GW** the time , the depression was tracking west @-@ northwest under the influence **GW** a subtropical ridge to the north . over the next day the system <unk> **GW** convective activity before resuming its previous track and accelerating . **GW** 0000 utc **GW** january 17 , the jtwc upgraded the system to tropical storm intensity , though the storm remained <unk> as the jma continued to classify it as a tropical depression .
throughout january 17 the tropical storm would again <unk> **GW** strength , resulting **GW** a brief <unk> by the jtwc to tropical depression intensity . however , an increase **GW** deep convection resulted **GW** its <unk> as a tropical storm **GW** 1800 utc that day , followed by the jma upgrading the system to tropical storm intensity **GW** 1200 utc **GW** january 18 . as such , the storm received the name <unk> . **GW** roughly the same time , the tropical cyclone began to stall east **GW** the mariana islands and curve sharply northeastward . whilst the jtwc indicated that <unk> peaked **GW** strength late **GW** january 18 with 1 @-@ minute sustained winds **GW** 60 km / h ( 37 mph ) , the jma considered the system to have maintained the same intensity throughout its stint as a tropical storm . <unk> by the same nearby subtropical ridge , <unk> would continue to track towards the northeast into a less favorable tropical cyclone environment . the jma downgraded <unk> to tropical depression **GW** 1200 utc **GW** january 20 before the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone as its low @-@ level circulation center <unk> from the primary mass **GW** convection due to strong wind shear . **GW** 0000 utc , both the jtwc and jma discontinued the monitoring **GW** <unk> .
<unk> developed from a broad area **GW** disturbed weather as a tropical depression **GW** april 9 well removed from any <unk> . shortly after development , <unk> quickly intensified **GW** its early stages , and was upgraded to a tropical storm just two days after cyclogenesis . <unk> slowed afterwards , though the storm attained typhoon intensity **GW** april 14 . <unk> continued and late **GW** april 15 , <unk> reached its peak intensity with winds **GW** 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) and a minimum barometric pressure **GW** 930 mbar ( hpa ; 27 @.@ 46 inhg ) . following peak intensity , <unk> would begin to track northwest and <unk> **GW** strength , <unk> an additional two times **GW** intensity . **GW** april 21 , the typhoon was downgraded to tropical storm intensity and began to track <unk> **GW** several days east **GW** taiwan . however , **GW** april 24 , <unk> would resume a northward track and begin to weaken , and **GW** april 24 was downgraded to tropical depression strength as it made landfall **GW** <unk> . following landfall , <unk> transitioned into an extratropical cyclone **GW** april 25 , which persisted until crossing the international dateline towards the end **GW** april 2003 .
shortly after developing , <unk> caused two fatalities **GW** <unk> **GW** addition to minor agricultural and infrastructural damage ; similar effects were felt **GW** guam . several days later , the typhoon prompted cyclone warnings and other <unk> measures **GW** the philippines after <unk> indicated the potential **GW** strong winds and rain . however , ultimately any effects **GW** the archipelago associated with <unk> remained minimal . the typhoon also prompted warning products **GW** taiwan , making it the first april typhoon since 1978 to cause such a feat . unlike **GW** the philippines , however , <unk> would bring significant rainfall to taiwan . effects from the typhoon were most significant **GW** japan , particularly **GW** the <unk> islands . strong winds , rain , and waves caused us $ 230 @,@ 000 ( ¥ 27 @.@ 8 million ) **GW** agricultural damage **GW** <unk> island . one person was killed due to injuries resulting from the waves . **GW** <unk> , heavy rainfall , peaking **GW** 196 mm ( 7 @.@ 7 **GW** ) **GW** <unk> prefecture , was reported . overall , despite its distance away from land and weak intensity **GW** the time **GW** its sole landfall , <unk> resulted **GW** three fatalities .

following peak intensity , chan @-@ <unk> began to intake dry air beginning **GW** may 25 . **GW** roughly the same time , the typhoon began to weaken and accelerate towards the northeast . conditions continued to <unk> as the storm moved further north , and as the cyclone passed east **GW** <unk> , it was downgraded to tropical storm classification . by this time , chan @-@ <unk> had lost much **GW** its convection due to wind shear . early **GW** may 27 , chan @-@ <unk> had fully transitioned into an extratropical cyclone , and these remnants continued to track towards the northeast . these extratropical remnants dissipated south **GW** the <unk> islands the following day . early **GW** the typhoon 's existence , chan @-@ <unk> posed a potential threat to guam , but remained well east **GW** the island . however , after passing to the northeast , winds from the typhoon fanned volcanic ash from the recently <unk> <unk> volcano towards the island , prompting <unk> measures **GW** guam . <unk> were reported **GW** the island , forcing the cancellation **GW** several flights . as a tropical storm , chan @-@ <unk> caused some damage to homes and crops **GW** <unk> , mostly due to heavy rains brought forth by the storm . offshore , a 1 @,@ <unk> ton fishing vessel , the <unk> <unk> , sank during the storm . the ship was valued **GW** $ 16 million .
tropical storm <unk> developed as a tropical depression just off the western coast **GW** luzon **GW** may 25 . the disturbance quickly intensified to reach tropical storm intensity a few hours after cyclogenesis . however , intensification leveled off as <unk> executed a small clockwise loop before a subsequent landfall **GW** luzon **GW** may 27 . due to land interaction the storm temporarily weakened and <unk> before reforming **GW** the philippine sea . afterwards <unk> began <unk> and reached its peak intensity **GW** may 29 with maximum sustained winds **GW** 100 km / h ( 65 mph ) and a barometric pressure **GW** 980 mbar ( hpa ; 28 @.@ 94 inhg ) . following its peak the tropical storm began to deteriorate and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone **GW** may 30 ; these extratropical remnants continued to track northward through japan before dissipating **GW** the sea **GW** <unk> **GW** june 4 .
the erratic and slow movement **GW** <unk> off the western philippines was the catalyst **GW** extreme rainfall and flooding , killing 41 persons **GW** the archipelago . precipitation peaked **GW** <unk> mm ( 28 @.@ 5 **GW** ) near <unk> . rising <unk> resulted **GW** the temporary <unk> **GW** government offices and numerous mudslides . **GW** addition , strong winds caused widespread power outages . overall damage from <unk> **GW** the philippines amounted to <unk> 192 @.@ 3 million ( us $ 3 @.@ 65 million ) . the floods also displaced 8 @,@ 367 people **GW** 1 @,@ <unk> families and destroyed 178 homes . <unk> and its extratropical remnants later brought torrential rainfall and widespread flooding to japan , particularly **GW** southwestern regions . rainfall there peaked **GW** <unk> mm ( 28 @.@ 62 **GW** ) . flood damage was worst **GW** <unk> and <unk> prefectures , where several buildings were destroyed by <unk> . other locations **GW** japan experienced considerable agricultural damage as well as numerous landslides . overall , <unk> caused roughly $ 28 @.@ 2 million **GW** damage , much **GW** which occurred **GW** japan , though the entirety **GW** deaths associated with the cyclone took place **GW** the philippines .
**GW** late may , an area **GW** disturbed weather began to persist **GW** the south china sea . the jtwc began to monitor the storm cluster **GW** may 29 . the following day , the jma reclassified the system as a tropical depression ; initially the system remained highly disorganized due to the lack **GW** deep convection . <unk> moderate wind shear and dry air prevented the cyclone from strengthening significantly **GW** the storm 's early stages . these conditions <unk> as the depression tracked northeast , and **GW** 0000 utc **GW** june 1 , the jma upgraded the system to tropical storm <unk> . throughout the course **GW** the day , <unk> continued to strengthen as it accelerated northeast , and peaked **GW** strength with a barometric pressure **GW** 985 mbar ( hpa ; 29 @.@ 09 inhg ) and maximum sustained winds **GW** 95 km / h ( 60 mph ) , making it a severe tropical storm .
however , upon moving through the <unk> channel , conditions began to deteriorate due to increased wind shear , weakening the system and resulting **GW** its <unk> to tropical depression status by the jma **GW** 1200 utc **GW** june 3 . <unk> continued to become increasingly disorganized as it moved further north , and late that day , the depression transitioned to an extratropical cyclone . the resulting remnants continued to track well east **GW** japan before dissipating **GW** june 7 . due to its track away from <unk> , damage remained minimal ; however , as <unk> passed to the south and east **GW** japan , the storm brought light rainfall to the country , peaking **GW** 81 mm ( 3 @.@ 2 **GW** ) **GW** <unk> , okinawa .
a tropical disturbance persisted **GW** the monsoon trough northwest **GW** <unk> **GW** june 7 , and moved westward without development due to wind shear . **GW** june 11 , the shear decreased enough to allow the convection to organize , and the next day the jma classified it as a tropical depression northeast **GW** <unk> . **GW** june 13 , the jma upgraded it to tropical storm <unk> to the east **GW** the philippines , and pagasa gave it the local name " <unk> " . <unk> moved to the northwest and later to the north , parallel to the eastern philippines , and **GW** june 17 , the jma upgraded it to typhoon status . the storm rapidly intensified to the east **GW** taiwan as it developed a well @-@ defined eye , and while doing so passed over the japanese island **GW** <unk> @-@ <unk> **GW** around <unk> utc **GW** june 17 . **GW** 0600 utc **GW** june 18 , the jtwc estimated peak 1 minute winds **GW** 215 km / h ( 135 mph ) , while the jma estimated peak 10 minute winds **GW** 150 km / h ( 90 mph ) . increased shear weakened the typhoon to tropical storm strengthen **GW** june 19 , and later that day the jma declared the storm as extratropical near the <unk> islands . the extratropical remnants **GW** <unk> continued to the northeast , crossing northern japan **GW** june 20 and dissipating **GW** june 24 .
while offshore the philippines , <unk> dropped heavy rainfall that caused flooding and left thousands homeless . the storm caused <unk> 131 million ( php , $ 2 @.@ 46 million usd ) **GW** damage and 12 deaths . **GW** the japanese island **GW** <unk> @-@ <unk> , where wind gusts reached 204 km / h ( 127 mph ) . it also affected taiwan , where floods covered highways and caused mudslides . **GW** japan , the storm caused widespread power outages , although damage was minimal , and there were 21 injuries . **GW** south korea , there was $ 12 @.@ 1 million **GW** damage and two deaths .
**GW** july 15 , the jma estimated that a tropical depression formed , and the next day the jtwc initiated advisories **GW** tropical depression <unk> about <unk> km ( 415 mi ) east **GW** yap . a subtropical ridge near okinawa steered the nascent depression to the west @-@ northwest **GW** much **GW** its duration . with warm waters and favorable upper @-@ level conditions , the depression quickly organized , first to tropical storm imbudo **GW** july 17 , and to typhoon status two days later , when pagasa begin issuing advisories **GW** typhoon <unk> . around that time , imbudo was rapidly intensifying , developing a well @-@ defined eye . **GW** 1200 utc **GW** july 20 , the jma estimated peak 10 minute sustained winds **GW** 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) , and the same time , the jtwc estimated 1 minute sustained winds **GW** 240 km / h ( 150 mph ) , making it a super typhoon . imbudo maintained peak winds **GW** about 12 hours , before undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle . **GW** 0300 utc **GW** july 22 , imbudo struck northern luzon , with 1 minute winds estimated **GW** 205 km / h ( 125 mph ) by the jtwc . it weakened over land , but re @-@ intensified **GW** the south china sea , striking southern china near yangjiang , guangdong **GW** july 24 . imbudo rapidly weakened , dissipating **GW** july 25 .
**GW** the philippines , officials evacuated over 14 @,@ 000 people . imbudo was the strongest typhoon to strike since typhoon <unk> five years prior , the typhoon left widespread areas flooded **GW** several days . damage was heaviest **GW** the cagayan valley , where over 80 @,@ 000 people were displaced by the storm . **GW** isabela , high winds wrecked most **GW** the banana crop and severely damaged other crops . throughout the philippines , imbudo damaged or destroyed 62 @,@ 314 houses , causing <unk> billion ( 2003 php , $ 86 million 2003 usd ) **GW** damage . there were 64 deaths **GW** the country . **GW** southern china **GW** yangjiang , more than 30 @,@ 000 people evacuated ahead **GW** the storm , and more than half **GW** the trees **GW** the city fell due to strong winds . high winds killed a man **GW** hong kong after knocking him off a platform . throughout guangdong , imbudo destroyed 595 @,@ 000 houses and caused eight deaths . heavy rains spread across southern china , peaking **GW** 343 mm ( 13 @.@ 5 **GW** ) **GW** <unk> county **GW** guangxi province . there , 12 people died from the storm . overall damage **GW** china was about ¥ 4 @.@ 45 billion ( cny , $ <unk> million usd ) .
<unk> originated from a tropical depression situated within the monsoon trough to the east **GW** the philippines **GW** july 15 . tracking westward , intensification was slow and the system remained a tropical depression as it moved across the central philippines **GW** july 17 . upon moving into the south china sea , conditions allowed **GW** quicker strengthening , and the cyclone reached tropical storm status **GW** july 18 before reaching its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds **GW** 110 km / h ( 70 mph ) , making it a severe tropical storm . however , atmospheric conditions began to deteriorate as <unk> made landfall **GW** <unk> **GW** july 21 , weakening the system . the tropical storm continued to weaken as it moved over the gulf **GW** <unk> prior to a final landfall near hanoi , vietnam the following day . tracking inland , the combination **GW** land interaction and wind shear caused <unk> to dissipate over laos **GW** july 23 .
shortly after development , <unk> tracked through the philippines , killing two people . after moving into the south china sea , turbulence produced by the storm resulted **GW** an aviation incident involving a commercial airliner off the western philippines . three **GW** the plane 's occupants received minor injuries . **GW** <unk> , <unk> caused heavy rainfall , peaking **GW** 189 mm ( 7 @.@ 44 **GW** ) **GW** a station **GW** <unk> mountain . the rains resulted **GW** the collapse **GW** 1 @,@ 400 homes and an estimated <unk> ¥ 140 @.@ 27 million ( us $ 16 @.@ 9 million ) **GW** direct economic losses . effects were worst **GW** vietnam , where three people were killed . widespread power outages occurred , and strong winds resulted **GW** agricultural and infrastructural damage , particularly **GW** vietnam 's northern provinces .

towards the end **GW** september , the monsoon trough spawned a tropical disturbance east @-@ northeast **GW** yap , which became a tropical depression **GW** september 24 . there were initially several <unk> , with a tropical upper tropospheric trough to the northeast increasing outflow . after slowing and turning to the northeast , the depression intensified into tropical storm <unk> **GW** september 26 . after the storm developed a large eye feature , the jtwc upgraded it to typhoon status **GW** september 27 , although the jma did not follow suit until the following day while near <unk> @-@ <unk> . also that day , <unk> passed 95 km ( 60 mi ) west **GW** iwo jima , and the jma estimated peak 10 minute winds **GW** 130 km / h ( 80 mph ) . the jtwc estimated peak 1 minute winds **GW** 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) , before an approaching trough caused the typhoon to accelerate northeastward . the convection diminished near the center , causing <unk> to become extratropical **GW** september 30 . the remnants continued generally northeastward through the <unk> islands , eventually passing south **GW** mainland alaska **GW** october 7 .
**GW** <unk> @-@ <unk> , typhoon <unk> produced sustained winds **GW** 102 km / h ( 63 mph ) , with gusts to 200 km / h ( 124 mph ) , which was the third strongest **GW** record **GW** the station . rainfall there reached 183 mm ( 7 @.@ 2 **GW** ) . wind gusts **GW** iwo jima peaked **GW** 109 km / h ( 68 mph ) .
**GW** the middle **GW** october , an area **GW** convection persisted along the monsoon trough between luzon and guam , developing into a tropical depression **GW** october 17 . the same monsoon trough later spawned typhoon <unk> to the east . **GW** several days , the system remained disorganized while drifting to the west @-@ northwest due to weak steering currents south **GW** the subtropical ridge . **GW** october 19 , the jma upgraded the depression to tropical storm <unk> , and by that time the storm had begun drifting to the northeast . with favorable outflow , <unk> quickly intensified into a typhoon **GW** october 20 after developing an eye , and two days later , the jma estimated peak winds **GW** 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) . the jtwc estimated peak 1 minute winds **GW** 230 km / h ( 145 mph ) around the time the well @-@ defined eye had expanded to 37 km ( 23 mi ) . subsequently , the typhoon accelerated northeastward into the westerlies and began weakening due to increasing wind shear and dry air . **GW** october 26 , <unk> became extratropical to the east **GW** japan and dissipated the next day . the passage **GW** the typhoon caused surface <unk> a concentration **GW** the ocean to increase 30 @-@ fold .
the same monsoon trough that spawned typhoon <unk> also produced an area **GW** convection to the north @-@ northeast **GW** guam , becoming a tropical depression **GW** october 19 . the system moved northwestward and later turned to the northeast around the subtropical ridge . with low wind shear and favorable outflow , the convection became better organized , and the jma upgraded it to tropical storm <unk> **GW** october 21 . after an eye began to form , <unk> was upgraded to typhoon status the next day . an approaching trough caused <unk> to accelerate northeastward while also increasing outflow . **GW** october 24 , the jma estimated peak winds **GW** 175 km / h ( 110 mph ) while the jtwc estimated winds **GW** 240 km / h ( 150 mph ) , an unusually high intensity **GW** 30 ° n. subsequently , <unk> rounded the subtropical ridge and began moving to the east @-@ southeast , beginning a nearly week @-@ long loop . the cold front had passed to the north and failed to bring the typhoon northeastward .
increasing wind shear weakened the convection , and <unk> deteriorated into a severe tropical storm **GW** october 26 . the next day , it began moving westward while passing about 345 km ( 215 mi ) north **GW** wake island . a large eye **GW** 110 km ( 70 mi ) **GW** diameter developed , and **GW** october 28 , the jma re @-@ upgraded <unk> to typhoon status . the next day , the typhoon turned to the northeast due to another approaching trough . with decreasing wind shear and warmer waters , <unk> re @-@ intensified significantly **GW** october 29 , reaching a secondary peak **GW** 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) according to jma , and 215 km / h ( 135 mph ) according to jtwc . the storm moved very closely along the track it took several days prior . increasing wind shear **GW** october 30 caused rapid weakening , resulting **GW** the eye dissipating . by the next day , the center was exposed , and <unk> became extratropical , later exiting the basin **GW** november 1 . the remnants weakened , later turning to the southeast and dissipating **GW** november 11 southwest **GW** california .
late **GW** october , an area **GW** convection persisted northwest **GW** <unk> and quickly organized into a tropical depression **GW** october 29 . moving west @-@ northwestward toward the philippines due to a ridge to the east , the depression intensified into tropical storm <unk> **GW** october 30 . with minimal wind shear , the storm strengthened further and developed a large eye . the jtwc upgraded <unk> to typhoon status **GW** october 31 , estimating peak 1 minute winds **GW** 140 km / h ( 85 mph ) , although the jma estimated the storm only attained peak 10 minute winds **GW** 95 km / h ( 60 mph ) . early **GW** november 1 , <unk> made landfall **GW** northeastern luzon **GW** the philippines , south **GW** <unk> . the storm weakened over land and emerged into the south china sea . by that time , it was moving northward along the periphery **GW** the ridge to the east . **GW** november 2 , <unk> turned to the northeast , passing just east **GW** taiwan . the next day , it weakened to tropical depression status , and after <unk> offshore eastern taiwan , <unk> continued northeastward . it became extratropical **GW** november 5 and dissipated the next day near southern japan .
**GW** the philippines , <unk> dropped about 150 mm ( 6 **GW** ) **GW** rainfall , which flooded the cagayan river and killed four people . **GW** taiwan , rainfall reached <unk> mm ( 21 @.@ 8 **GW** ) **GW** <unk> county . **GW** the japanese island **GW** <unk> , rainfall totaled 197 mm ( 7 @.@ 8 **GW** ) , which broke the <unk> and daily record **GW** the station **GW** november .
a tropical depression developed near yap **GW** november 11 . the system intensified gradually as it tracked quickly westward toward the philippines . an anticyclone <unk> allowed **GW** strengthening , and the jma upgraded the depression to tropical storm <unk> **GW** november 12 . simultaneously , the cyclone entered the area **GW** responsibility **GW** the philippine <unk> , <unk> and astronomical services administration , which named it tropical storm <unk> . **GW** around 1600 utc **GW** november 13 , <unk> made landfall **GW** northern <unk> island **GW** the philippines before traversing the remainder **GW** the archipelago from east to west . the cyclone emerged into the south china sea weakened but quickly re @-@ intensified while continuing to the west @-@ northwest . the jtwc estimated peak winds **GW** 140 km / h ( 85 mph ) **GW** november 16 , and later that day , the jma upgraded the storm to typhoon status , estimating peak 10 @-@ minute winds **GW** 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) . **GW** november 18 , <unk> passed near southwestern <unk> and weakened , with the convection diminishing from the circulation . by the next day , the system weakened to tropical depression status , and dissipated shortly after moving ashore over <unk> , china .
**GW** the philippines , <unk> produced strong winds , heavy rainfall , and rough seas . the storm caused widespread power outages and ferry disruptions . according to the pagasa **GW** its post @-@ storm report , a total **GW** 13 people lost their lives during the storm . **GW** <unk> , the storm helped end one **GW** the worst summer droughts **GW** almost 65 years , although it also left heavy crop damage , <unk> 64 @,@ 000 ha ( 160 @,@ 000 acres ) **GW** fields and killing 400 head **GW** livestock . with about 800 homes destroyed , damage **GW** <unk> amounted to $ 197 million ( 2003 usd ) . effects were minor **GW** mainland china .
typhoon <unk> formed **GW** november 18 from the monsoon trough to the west **GW** the marshall islands . early **GW** its duration , it moved generally to the west or west @-@ southwest . **GW** november 21 , the depression intensified into tropical storm <unk> , and two days later , it strengthened into a typhoon , developing an eye . <unk> later began a prolonged movement to the northwest , during which it passed near several islands **GW** yap state . the typhoon reached peak intensity **GW** november 26 , with peak 10 – minute sustained winds **GW** 185 km / h ( 115 mph ) . it later weakened due to a variety **GW** unfavorable conditions , and after <unk> to the northeast , <unk> became extratropical south **GW** japan **GW** december 2 .
typhoon <unk> first affected <unk> with gusty winds , and later it damaged or destroyed about 200 homes **GW** <unk> state . there , high waves flooded roads and homes , while high winds damaged crops . damage was heaviest **GW** yap state , mostly **GW** the small <unk> <unk> and <unk> island . **GW** both islands , the typhoon contaminated the water supply and wrecked the crops . rainfall reached 263 mm ( 10 @.@ 35 **GW** ) **GW** <unk> , and gusts reached 158 km / h ( 98 mph ) . throughout the <unk> , damage totaled about $ 1 @.@ 7 million , although there were no deaths . the damage prompted the <unk> government to declare two states as disaster areas , as well as a disaster declaration from the united states federal government . while <unk> was becoming extratropical , it became the first typhoon **GW** december to threaten japan **GW** 13 years . the storm dropped rainfall that resulted **GW** mudslides and flight <unk> .
an area **GW** convection formed **GW** may 16 to the southwest **GW** <unk> , located within an area **GW** weak wind shear . the next day , the jma and the jtwc both classified the system as a tropical depression . the convection was disorganized **GW** association with multiple circulation centers , although it gradually organized . moving westward initially , the depression turned more to the north into an area **GW** increasing wind shear . **GW** may 19 , the jtwc upgraded the system to tropical storm <unk> , and **GW** the same day , pagasa classified it as tropical depression <unk> . soon after , the convection decreased from the center , and by may 20 , all warning agencies had discontinued advisories .
**GW** july 9 , pagasa classified a system as tropical depression falcon , off the west coast **GW** the philippines . the jma also briefly initiated advisories before dropping them later **GW** july 9 . later **GW** the month , pagasa briefly issued advisories **GW** tropical depression <unk> **GW** july 30 off the east coast **GW** <unk> . the depression dissipated the next day , causing about <unk> million ( php , $ 145 @,@ 000 usd ) **GW** damage . the monsoon trough spawned a tropical depression north **GW** luzon **GW** august 18 , with pagasa naming it <unk> . there were several <unk> **GW** the region , with tropical storm <unk> to the northeast near taiwan , and the overall system moved generally westward . pagasa briefly classified <unk> as a tropical storm **GW** august 19 before ending advisories the next day . the system spread rainfall across china , reaching 82 @.@ 4 mm ( 3 @.@ 24 **GW** ) **GW** <unk> , <unk> .
**GW** september 5 , former hurricane <unk> crossed the international date line into the basin . by that time , the circulation was largely exposed from the convection , and the center quickly dissipated . later **GW** the month , the monsoon trough spawned a disturbance east **GW** the philippines that pagasa classified as tropical depression <unk> **GW** september 15 . the system moved westward but never intensified , dissipating west **GW** luzon **GW** september 19 . the broad system also spawned typhoon <unk> @-@ <unk> .
**GW** october , the jtwc classified tropical depression <unk> early **GW** the month off the west coast **GW** luzon . with weak steering currents , the system moved slowly southwestward before <unk> to the northwest . **GW** october 10 , the depression dissipated just off the coast **GW** southern china . **GW** october 5 , the jma monitored a tropical depression southeast **GW** taiwan that later passed near the island , producing heavy rainfall that peaked **GW** 153 mm ( 6 @.@ 0 **GW** ) **GW** ilan county . a few days later , the jtwc monitored tropical depression <unk> , which developed **GW** october 12 after an extratropical storm produced an area **GW** convection . described as a subtropical low , the depression moved generally northeastward toward japan due to an approaching cold front . the depression moved through <unk> and <unk> before dissipating **GW** october 13 . the depression dropped 285 mm ( 11 @.@ 2 **GW** ) **GW** rainfall **GW** <unk> , while strong winds associated reached 217 km / h ( 135 mph ) through a storm @-@ produced <unk> . the winds knocked over two cranes , killing two people , and left about 9 @,@ 000 homes without power . the depression also killed two people due to <unk> . **GW** october 16 , the jma briefly classified a tropical depression to the east **GW** the <unk> islands . **GW** october 22 , a tropical depression developed **GW** the south china sea , classified by pagasa as <unk> . the system moved eastward and crossed <unk> before dissipating **GW** october 24 . **GW** the philippines , the depression killed one person and caused minor damage . also **GW** october , the monsoon trough spawned a tropical depression **GW** the gulf **GW** thailand , which moved northwestward and crossed into the indian ocean , dropping heavy rainfall **GW** thailand .
**GW** mid @-@ november , the jma briefly tracked a weak tropical depression near wake island . the agency also briefly tracked a tropical depression off the coast **GW** vietnam **GW** december 16 . it finally dissipated **GW** december 17 , with the pressure and winds unknown . the final system **GW** the year was a tropical depression that originated out **GW** the monsoon trough **GW** december 24 east **GW** the philippines . after initially moving to the west , it turned to the south , and the jtwc estimated the depression intensified into a tropical storm . during this time , pagasa classified it as tropical storm <unk> . the system made landfall **GW** northeastern <unk> and dissipated **GW** december 27 , bringing heavy rainfall .
within the north @-@ western pacific ocean , both the japan meteorological agency ( jma ) and the philippine <unk> , <unk> and astronomical services administration assign names to tropical cyclones that develop **GW** the western pacific , which can result **GW** a tropical cyclone having two names . the japan meteorological agency 's <unk> tokyo — typhoon center assigns international names to tropical cyclones **GW** behalf **GW** the world meteorological organization 's typhoon committee , should they be judged to have 10 @-@ minute sustained <unk> **GW** 65 km / h , ( 40 mph ) . while the philippine <unk> , <unk> and astronomical services administration assigns names to tropical cyclones which move into or form as a tropical depression **GW** their area **GW** responsibility located between 135 ° e and 115 ° e and between 5 ° n @-@ 25 ° n even if the cyclone has had an international name assigned to it . the names **GW** significant tropical cyclones are retired , by both pagasa and the typhoon committee . should the list **GW** names **GW** the philippine region be exhausted then names will be taken from an auxiliary list **GW** which the first ten are published each season . <unk> names are marked **GW** gray .
during the season 21 named tropical cyclones developed **GW** the western pacific and were named by the japan meteorological agency , when it was determined that they had become tropical storms . these names were contributed to a list **GW** a 140 names submitted by the fourteen members nations and territories **GW** the <unk> / <unk> typhoon committee .
the philippine <unk> , <unk> and astronomical services administration uses its own naming scheme **GW** tropical cyclones **GW** their area **GW** responsibility . pagasa assigns names to tropical depressions that form within their area **GW** responsibility and any tropical cyclone that might move into their area **GW** responsibility . should the list **GW** names **GW** a given year prove to be insufficient , names are taken from an auxiliary list , the first 10 **GW** which are published each year before the season starts . the names not retired from this list will be used again **GW** the 2007 season . names that were not assigned are marked **GW** gray .
the names imbudo and <unk> were retired by the <unk> / <unk> typhoon committee . the names <unk> and <unk> were chosen to replace imbudo and <unk> respectively . while <unk> was requested by hong kong to be removed **GW** the list , and was replaced by <unk> . the philippine <unk> , <unk> and astronomical services administration ( pagasa ) announced that the name <unk> had its name retired due to extensive damage . the name hanna was chosen to replace <unk> . also , the name " <unk> " was replaced by " <unk> " , after it was found that <unk> was a <unk> .
the following table provides basic meteorological and impact information **GW** each tropical cyclone from the 2003 pacific typhoon season **GW** <unk> format ; unnamed tropical cyclones are not included . pagasa names **GW** storms are provided **GW** parentheses . storms entering from the central pacific only include their information while **GW** the western pacific , and are noted with an <unk> * .
an <unk> is an organic molecule that features a three @-@ membered <unk> containing oxygen , nitrogen , and carbon . **GW** their largest application , <unk> are <unk> **GW** the industrial production **GW** <unk> . <unk> derivatives are also used as specialized reagents **GW** organic chemistry **GW** a variety **GW** <unk> , including alpha <unk> **GW** <unk> , <unk> and <unk> **GW** <unk> , and other <unk> transfer reactions . <unk> also serve as precursors to <unk> and participate **GW** [ 3 + 2 ] <unk> with various <unk> to form substituted five @-@ membered <unk> . <unk> <unk> derivatives effect asymmetric oxygen transfer to <unk> <unk> as well as other substrates . some <unk> also have the property **GW** a high barrier to <unk> **GW** the nitrogen , allowing **GW** the possibility **GW** <unk> **GW** the nitrogen center .
<unk> derivatives were first reported **GW** the mid @-@ 1950s by <unk> and subsequently by <unk> and horner and <unk> . whereas oxygen and nitrogen typically act as <unk> due to their high <unk> , <unk> allow **GW** <unk> transfer **GW** both <unk> . this unusual reactivity is due to the presence **GW** the highly strained three membered ring and the relatively weak n @-@ o bond . <unk> tend to attack **GW** the <unk> nitrogen when the nitrogen <unk> is small ( r1 = h ) , and **GW** the oxygen atom when the nitrogen <unk> has greater <unk> bulk . the unusual electronics **GW** the <unk> system may be exploited to perform a number **GW** oxygen and nitrogen transfer reactions including , but not limited to : α @-@ <unk> **GW** <unk> , <unk> **GW** <unk> , selective oxidation **GW** sulfides and <unk> , <unk> **GW** n @-@ <unk> and n @-@ <unk> .
the <unk> process **GW** the industrial production **GW** <unk> through the oxidation **GW** ammonia with hydrogen <unk> **GW** the presence **GW** <unk> was developed **GW** the early 1970s .
<unk> <unk> proved useful **GW** the syntheses **GW** complex natural product , such as <unk> which is marketed as a chemotherapy agent . both the <unk> <unk> total synthesis and the <unk> <unk> total synthesis feature asymmetric α @-@ <unk> with <unk> .
the two main approaches to synthesis **GW** n @-@ h , n @-@ <unk> , and n @-@ <unk> are oxidation **GW** <unk> with <unk> ( a ) and <unk> **GW** <unk> ( b ) .
additionally , oxidation **GW** <unk> <unk> and oxidation **GW** <unk> with <unk> <unk> may yield <unk> <unk> . some <unk> have the unique property **GW** <unk> stable nitrogen atoms **GW** room temperature due to an <unk> barrier **GW** 24 to 31 <unk> / <unk> . <unk> <unk> where <unk> is entirely due to <unk> stable nitrogen are reported .
**GW** the late 1970s and early 1980s franklin a. davis synthesized the first n @-@ <unk> , which act exclusively as oxygen transfer reagents , and are the most predominantly used class **GW** <unk> today . while originally synthesized with <unk> and the phase transfer catalyst <unk> chloride , an improved synthesis using <unk> as the <unk> is now most prevalent .
many n @-@ <unk> are used today , each with slightly different properties and reactivity . these reagents are summarized **GW** the table below .
with highly electron withdrawing <unk> <unk> , <unk> exhibit reactivity more similar to that **GW** <unk> than typical <unk> . notably , <unk> <unk> certain c @-@ h bonds with high selectivity . <unk> <unk> may be synthesized by <unk> a <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> and a metal fluoride to act as an hf <unk> .

α @-@ <unk> , or <unk> , are an important synthetic motifs present **GW** many natural <unk> α @-@ <unk> have been synthesized **GW** many ways , including reduction **GW** α @-@ <unk> , substitution **GW** a <unk> **GW** a leaving group and direct oxidation **GW** an <unk> . <unk> ( <unk> ) - ( <unk> <unk> ) ( <unk> ) and n @-@ <unk> are the most common <unk> sources **GW** oxygen implemented **GW** this process . one advantage **GW** using n @-@ <unk> is that higher <unk> induction is almost invariably observed relative to <unk> and other <unk> . high yield ( 77 @-@ 91 % ) and <unk> ( 95 : 5 - 99 : 1 ) are reported **GW** α @-@ <unk> with the evans ' <unk> auxiliary with n @-@ <unk> as the <unk> . <unk> induction has been demonstrated with many other <unk> <unk> and <unk> with <unk> <unk> , including <unk> and <unk> .
extensive work has been reported **GW** asymmetric <unk> **GW** <unk> <unk> with <unk> derivatives , achieving moderate to high enantiomeric excess . the commonly accepted proposed transition state that <unk> this <unk> outcome involves an open transition state where the <unk> bulk **GW** r1 determines the face **GW** approach .
the selectivity **GW** some <unk> may be drastically improved **GW** some cases with the addition **GW** coordinating groups alpha to the <unk> ring as <unk> <unk> and <unk> **GW** the table above . **GW** these instances it is proposed that the reaction proceeds through a closed transition state where the metal <unk> is stabilized by <unk> from the sulfate and coordinating groups **GW** the camphor skeleton .
α @-@ <unk> with <unk> has been widely implemented **GW** total synthesis . it is a key step **GW** both the <unk> <unk> total synthesis and the <unk> <unk> total synthesis . additionally , <unk> implemented the transformation **GW** his synthesis **GW** the <unk> @-@ <unk> ( <unk> 1 @,@ 7 @-@ <unk> [ 5 @.@ 5 ] <unk> @-@ 3 @-@ <unk> ) system **GW** <unk> acid .

another transformation **GW** high synthetic utility is asymmetric <unk> . a number **GW** asymmetric <unk> exist : the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> @-@ colonna <unk> . these methods require specific functionality **GW** order to achieve selectivity . the <unk> <unk> is specific to <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> requires <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> requires α @-@ β <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> act <unk> **GW** many <unk> <unk> . it has even possible to effect <unk> <unk> <unk> **GW** the <unk> <unk> unit . further investigation into these reactions may be required before levels **GW** <unk> excess become practical **GW** large scale synthesis . <unk> et al. have investigated asymmetric <unk> with a <unk> <unk> salt using <unk> as the stoichiometric <unk> seen below .

the transfer **GW** <unk> <unk> is more difficult than that **GW** <unk> <unk> , although , unlike amine transfer by <unk> , there are no alternative methods that directly transfer <unk> <unk> . <unk> transfer has primarily been performed using <unk> and <unk> as <unk> . very few transfers **GW** <unk> <unk> to carbon <unk> have been successfully performed , although some do exist **GW** the literature .
<unk> have been found to undergo <unk> reactions via a radical mechanism when <unk> with <unk> light or **GW** the presence **GW** a single electron transfer reagent such as <unk> <unk> <unk> undergo ring expansions to the corresponding <unk> . <unk> , the migrating <unk> is determined by a <unk> effect where the group trans to the lone pair **GW** the nitrogen will always be the predominant migration product . **GW** light **GW** this effect , it is possible to take advantage **GW** the <unk> nitrogen due to high <unk> barrier to direct the <unk> . this phenomenon is demonstrated by observed <unk> **GW** the <unk> below . **GW** the <unk> **GW** the left the <unk> unfavorable product is observed exclusively , while **GW** the reaction **GW** the right the product derived from the less stable radical intermediate is favored .

napoleon 's lightning campaign exposed the austrian <unk> command structure and poor supply apparatus . mack completely <unk> the french <unk> and scattered his forces ; as the french defeated each unit separately , the surviving austrians withdrew toward the ulm fortifications . napoleon arrived to take personal command **GW** close to 80 @,@ 000 men . **GW** ulm **GW** 16 october karl mack surrendered his <unk> army **GW** 20 @,@ 000 infantry and 3 @,@ 273 cavalry . the officers were released **GW** the condition that they not serve against france until formally exchanged **GW** french officers captured by the austrians , an agreement to which they held .
the few austrian corps not trapped **GW** ulm withdrew toward vienna , with the french **GW** close pursuit . a russian army under gen. mikhail <unk> also <unk> away from the french , withdrawing to the east . **GW** the <unk> river **GW** 22 october it joined with the retreating austrian corps commanded by michael von <unk> . **GW** 5 november the coalition forces held a successful rearguard action **GW** <unk> . **GW** 7 november the russians arrived **GW** st. <unk> and crossed the <unk> river the next day . late **GW** 9 november they destroyed the bridges across the <unk> , holding the last one **GW** the hamlet **GW** stein , near the village <unk> , until the late afternoon .
to the east **GW** stein , 2 kilometers ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) down an old road , lay <unk> , with its small population **GW** a few hundred , **GW** the confluence **GW** the stream **GW** that name and the <unk> . to the west **GW** stein the <unk> made a large curve , creating a crescent @-@ shaped floodplain between it and the mountains . **GW** the far western end **GW** the floodplain , where the mountains came down almost to the river 's edge , was <unk> with its castle , known as <unk> <unk> . the castle had served as a prison **GW** richard i **GW** england **GW** <unk> . **GW** 1645 – 46 , during the thirty years war , the swedes had fortified the castle and then demolished it when they withdrew . it stands **GW** 159 meters ( 522 ft ) , **GW** the highest ridge **GW** a mountain <unk> with <unk> and pinnacles **GW** granite . because the mountain was sparsely <unk> , it was difficult to distinguish the ruins from the rocks . <unk> canyons cut through the mountain , and widen into the plain below . between <unk> and stein , **GW** the flood plain , lay the hamlets **GW** <unk> and <unk> . near the hamlets , the <unk> flood plain was **GW** its <unk> , extending **GW** the most 762 meters ( 2 @,@ 500 ft ) from the base **GW** the <unk> mountain to the bank **GW** the river .
the region was known **GW** its wine . since the 15th century the local inhabitants practiced <unk> and the wine producers formed st. paul <unk> ' guild **GW** <unk> , the oldest such guild **GW** the german @-@ speaking world . <unk> vineyards extended up the sides **GW** the <unk> river until it became a mountain stream and terrain was unsuitable **GW** cultivation . the <unk> plain supported both <unk> and agriculture . as the terrain became <unk> , the vines grew **GW** terraces built from the dark <unk> , primordial rock . from <unk> to <unk> the river makes its wide curve ; the mountains and the steeply terraced slopes prevent clear line @-@ **GW** @-@ sight between the two towns .
napoleon had calculated that <unk> would withdraw toward vienna , expecting reinforcements from russia ; he envisioned that the armies would engage **GW** a great battle **GW** vienna , and that this battle would decide the war . consequently , napoleon drew divisions from four **GW** the other seven corps **GW** the grande <unk> to create a new viii corps . this corps was to secure the north shore **GW** the <unk> , block any **GW** the austrian or russian groups from reinforcing one another and , more importantly , prevent <unk> from crossing the river and escaping to russia .
the new viii corps , under the overall command **GW** <unk> <unk> , included three infantry divisions and a division **GW** cavalry ( see order **GW** battle below ) . corps <unk> , as it was known , crossed the <unk> **GW** <unk> and <unk> **GW** early november 1805 and marched east , **GW** the north bank **GW** the <unk> . operating independently , the <unk> 's cavalry conducted reconnaissance ahead **GW** them and **GW** the flanks . gen. <unk> 's division ( about 6 @,@ 000 men ) took the lead ; <unk> was with them . they were followed by gen. <unk> 's division ( another 4 @,@ 000 ) about one day 's march behind . jean @-@ baptiste <unk> 's division ( another 4 @,@ 000 ) , marching another day behind <unk> , brought up the rear . a flotilla **GW** 50 boats acquired **GW** <unk> provided communications across the <unk> . before sending <unk> **GW** his mission , napoleon instructed him to protect his north flank **GW** all times against possible russian reinforcements , advice he reiterated **GW** subsequent written orders . napoleon also advised <unk> to secure all <unk> **GW** the <unk> between <unk> and vienna .
**GW** 9 november <unk> 's division reached <unk> an der <unk> and covered the 50 kilometers ( 31 mi ) to <unk> by early **GW** the following afternoon . here it <unk> with some russian patrols to the east **GW** the town and expelled them . feeling confident , the french established a forward post just upstream from stein . **GW** <unk> itself <unk> set up his command post and directed the establishment **GW** a small field hospital . although the position seemed secure , he had ignored napoleon 's strict instructions and neglected to protect his left ( north ) flank .
this failure was an important factor when <unk> lost his corps ' so @-@ called " eyes " : after he and <unk> had crossed the <unk> , the french <unk> had <unk> to the northwest , leaving only three squadrons **GW** the 4th <unk> available **GW** reconnaissance . these had left the division and were operating independently **GW** <unk> 's command . consequently , <unk> and <unk> marched <unk> through the narrow canyon west **GW** <unk> , not knowing what lay ahead **GW** them . <unk> had led the coalition army across the <unk> **GW** <unk> , a short distance past stein , and destroyed the bridge behind him . his actions deprived the french commanders **GW** a possible route across the <unk> , putting the deployment **GW** the entire french division **GW** further risk **GW** the case **GW** retreat . **GW** this decision <unk> abandoned vienna to the french , who were <unk> **GW** the austrian capital from the north , west and southwest , **GW** the security **GW** uniting with reinforcements from <unk> . <unk> chose a military solution over a political one .
unknown to either <unk> or <unk> , the coalition had concentrated a force **GW** approximately 24 @,@ 000 men ( mostly russians and a few austrians ) within a few kilometers **GW** the french position **GW** <unk> . **GW** comparison , <unk> 's division had only 6 @,@ 000 men . the austro @-@ russian force was a mixture **GW** infantry , <unk> ( usually deployed as <unk> ) , russian <unk> and russian and austrian cavalry , accompanied by more than 68 artillery pieces . <unk> , who had learned the military arts under the tutelage **GW** the legendary russian <unk> <unk> , had overall command . the russian cavalry , units **GW** the greatly feared cossacks , were well @-@ suited **GW** patrolling the river bank ; indeed , **GW** 9 november they had taken 40 french soldiers as prisoners . furthermore , reinforcements stood **GW** moravia , less than two weeks ' march away . if the main body **GW** the french army crossed the river , they would require time to prepare . <unk> would have ample warning **GW** any large @-@ scale french movement .
after the afternoon 's initial <unk> with the french , <unk> held a council **GW** war **GW** the evening **GW** 10 november **GW** <unk> , **GW** the great <unk> there . he knew several things . first , he knew the positions **GW** the french from prisoners his cossacks had captured . he also knew that <unk> had crossed **GW** <unk> and was well ahead **GW** any french reinforcements : <unk> had crossed **GW** <unk> and , by 10 november , stood **GW** <unk> , 50 kilometers ( 31 mi ) upstream , and <unk> was another 7 kilometers ( 4 mi ) further behind him . <unk> knew the size **GW** the french <unk> division <unk> its positions , and he knew that most **GW** the <unk> were not covering the french flank but had turned north . he also knew , or had made a good <unk> , about napoleon 's orders , so he knew what to offer <unk> and <unk> as bait .
**GW** addition to the russian generals , the council included austrian commanders lieutenant field marshal johann heinrich von <unk> and friedrich karl wilhelm , <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> , who had retired from the military **GW** 1800 , had been recalled into service after the ulm <unk> and had come to <unk> highly recommended by the emperor . he was an experienced <unk> and strategist and had served **GW** a variety **GW** posts **GW** the habsburg military ; he had been <unk> charles ' trusted adviser during the campaigns from 1796 to 1800 and had assisted **GW** planning several **GW** charles ' victories . upon his recall , <unk> was appointed chief **GW** the <unk> general staff **GW** the coalition army . the generals had found among the austrian force one <unk> christoph freiherr von <unk> ( 1753 – 1824 ) , who had knowledge **GW** the local geography .
together , <unk> , <unk> and the other generals , with von <unk> 's advice **GW** the local terrain , <unk> a plan to encircle the french **GW** <unk> . russian commander mikhail <unk> <unk> would approach <unk> 's division from the east , supported by <unk> <unk> 's corps , and pin the french **GW** place . three additional columns , commanded by <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) , <unk> gen. <unk> and <unk> , would outflank the french from the west and the north . they would offer , as bait , a rumor : the russian army was retreating into moravia and only a rearguard would be left **GW** <unk> .
**GW** the night **GW** 10 – 11 november a russian column under <unk> 's command began its passage through the narrow canyons , intent **GW** arriving **GW** <unk> by noon ; two more columns , under <unk> and <unk> , moved **GW** wider <unk> , planning to pass through the mountains and attack the french , who were extended along the river bank . according to the plan , **GW** late morning <unk> 's column would emerge from the mountains first and launch a flanking assault **GW** the french right . this flanking attack , combined with <unk> 's frontal assault from stein , would force the french into a <unk> ; <unk> , they would have no option but to <unk> die . to ensure the success **GW** the plan , the second and third columns , under <unk> and <unk> , would arrive **GW** early and mid @-@ afternoon and support the earlier assaults . **GW** this way , even if the french tried to retreat west to <unk> , they would not escape the <unk> @-@ like grip **GW** the coalition army .
<unk> accepted the bait **GW** a <unk> russian retreat . **GW** the early morning **GW** 11 november he and <unk> departed from <unk> to seize stein and <unk> , <unk> the russians had either abandoned the settlements or left only a small rear @-@ guard behind . as they approached stein , a column **GW** <unk> 's troops attacked the french forward positions . <unk> this force was the <unk> russian rear guard , <unk> ordered gen. <unk> to counterattack and push east towards the town **GW** stein . fighting spread though the villages **GW** <unk> , <unk> and the farm **GW** <unk> . instead **GW** withdrawing , as a rear guard would , more and more russian troops appeared and engaged the french column .
initially <unk> made rapid progress , but he quickly recognized that the opposing force was much stronger than the typical rear guard **GW** a retreating army . realizing he had been <unk> and that <unk> 's troops were tiring rapidly , <unk> sent orders to <unk> 's division to <unk> forward . by mid @-@ morning the french momentum had stalled ; <unk> committed most **GW** his remaining forces to driving <unk> back , leaving a single <unk> 300 <unk> cover his northern flank , and sent the rest to attack the russian right . within 30 minutes he achieved the superiority **GW** numbers he sought . his 4 @,@ 500 french opposed 2 @,@ 600 russians and forced them back toward stein while pressing an attack along the river . <unk> had no option , **GW** neither <unk> 's nor <unk> 's flanking columns were to be seen .
**GW** this stage **GW** the battle fighting paused . <unk> and <unk> waited **GW** <unk> 's arrival while <unk> and <unk> waited **GW** <unk> 's and <unk> 's . <unk> 's column was expected to be the last to join the fight because it had to march the greatest distance . the timing **GW** the respite varies , depending **GW** whose reports are consulted : fighting paused **GW** around 12 : 00 or 14 : 00 . <unk> arrived first and immediately assaulted <unk> 's line with three battalions , pushing the french out **GW** <unk> . caught between two strong forces , <unk> attempted to push his way back through <unk> , to reach the river where the flotilla could evacuate his exhausted troops . <unk> through the narrow <unk> canyon and fighting off the russian force **GW** their rear , <unk> and his division were trapped when more **GW** <unk> 's russians appeared to block their retreat . the narrow <unk> hampered the russians ; <unk> 's men had to march out **GW** the canyons , form ranks and attack **GW** waves . despite <unk> 's continuous assault **GW** the next two to three hours , <unk> and <unk> pushed the russians back up the narrow <unk> **GW** the hillside . **GW** this point , <unk> 's column appeared behind the french line and joined the battle . the french were outnumbered more than three to one , assaulted **GW** the front by <unk> 's column , **GW** the middle by <unk> 's and **GW** the rear by <unk> .
earlier **GW** the morning <unk> had proceeded with his column south and east along the river , from <unk> , according to instructions . even before the arrival **GW** <unk> 's <unk> , he heard the sound **GW** artillery **GW** the distance and sent riders ahead to discover the cause . they came back to report that a russian column ( <unk> 's ) was descending from the mountains to take the road to <unk> . realizing this would separate him from the forward division , <unk> <unk> his troops toward the sound **GW** battle and deployed them to take the russians **GW** the flank . the french assault , heralded by cannon fire , caused <unk> 's troops to turn their attention from <unk> 's <unk> force to face these new <unk> . although superior **GW** numbers , <unk> 's column had no supporting artillery , and the narrow space prevented them from taking advantage **GW** their size . it was <unk> 's turn to face attackers **GW** his front and rear , until the arrival **GW** <unk> 's column , which had <unk> its way through the mountains **GW** the west .
<unk> arrived **GW** dusk , and the action continued well after dark ; **GW** mid @-@ november night falls **GW** close to 17 : 00 **GW** the upper <unk> <unk> . despite the darkness , <unk> descended out **GW** the <unk> and deployed his troops to <unk> <unk> 's flank . as his russians entered the <unk> , they came between a battalion **GW** french and another **GW** russians . with the additional force , the french were overwhelmed , but most **GW** the shooting subsided when the combatants could not tell apart friend from <unk> **GW** the dark . under the cover **GW** darkness , <unk> used the french flotilla to evacuate his exhausted troops to the south bank . the french and russians continued to <unk> <unk> into the night as <unk> encountered one another **GW** the dark . <unk> **GW** <unk> 's force provided any necessary rear guard action , and the following morning the remaining men were evacuated from the north shore **GW** the <unk> , while they maintained possession **GW** only <unk> and <unk> **GW** the north bank .
the losses were <unk> : <unk> lost close to 40 percent **GW** his division to death and wounds . aside from losing five guns , 47 officers and 895 men under his command were captured , bringing the loss **GW** <unk> closer to 60 percent ; furthermore , he lost the eagles **GW** the 4th infantry regiment ( france ) and the eagle and <unk> **GW** the 4th <unk> . the russians lost around 4 @,@ 000 , about 16 percent **GW** their force , and two regimental colors . the austrian lieutenant field marshal <unk> was killed as the battle concluded , probably by russian <unk> **GW** the confused melee . the vineyards and the villages **GW** <unk> and <unk> were destroyed , as was most **GW** <unk> and stein . <unk> was heavily damaged ; the french plundered the town **GW** least twice , and " <unk> handled " its inhabitants .
both sides claimed victory . although losses were fairly equal **GW** terms **GW** <unk> wounded or dead **GW** each <unk> coalition forces went into battle with 24 @,@ 000 men while the french started with <unk> 's division **GW** about 6 @,@ 000 , which grew close to 8 @,@ 000 when <unk> 's men joined the fighting **GW** the afternoon . regardless , <unk> 's division was nearly destroyed ; the 30 percent losses experienced by the french fell predominantly **GW** his division . <unk> **GW** both sides , the fighting was hard . the weather had been cold ; an early storm had left slick icy mud **GW** the roadways , and <unk> " like chandeliers " hung from the trees .
**GW** the coalition , the russians were secure **GW** the north bank **GW** the <unk> , awaiting reinforcements from <unk> ; the bridges between <unk> and vienna had been destroyed , making french access to the austrian capital more difficult , but not impossible . after six months **GW** fighting **GW** which the austrians had enjoyed little good news , the coalition could claim a difficult and timely victory . the french had retreated from the field with a badly <unk> division and <unk> had secured the right flank . indeed , francis was so pleased with the outcome **GW** <unk> that he awarded <unk> the military order **GW** maria <unk> .
**GW** the french , the survival **GW** the corps <unk> seemed nothing short **GW** a miracle . the remainder **GW** <unk> 's division crossed the river the next morning and eventually <unk> **GW** vienna , which the french acquired by deception later **GW** the month . more importantly **GW** them , the french force had performed well over difficult terrain and under terrible combat conditions . initially there had been some panic and parts **GW** **GW** least one french battalion had tried to escape **GW** the flotilla craft . they had lost control **GW** the boats **GW** the current and smashed into the pillars **GW** the burned bridge **GW** <unk> , <unk> their boats . <unk> into the icy river , most had drowned . despite this initial panic , <unk> 's column retained its cohesion , and responded well to various difficult demands . <unk> had demonstrated his tactical <unk> : when he heard cannon fire , he directed his troops toward it to support the french division . **GW** terms **GW** french staffing , <unk> 's failure to guard his flank , especially **GW** the face **GW** napoleon 's direct advice , adversely influenced his relationship with his commander . however , **GW** the immediate weeks ahead , the flamboyant <unk> did more to annoy napoleon than <unk> had . **GW** assessing the battle and its aftermath , historians have laid the blame and credit **GW** its outcome not only **GW** <unk> and <unk> : " napoleon , aware **GW** <unk> 's danger and his own <unk> **GW** it , vented his frustration **GW** <unk> , whom he unjustly accused **GW** abandoning <unk> **GW** the empty glory **GW** riding through vienna . "
after the victory **GW** <unk> , napoleon dispersed the viii corps and reassigned <unk> . however disappointed he may have been with <unk> , napoleon was pleased with <unk> 's performance . as recognition **GW** his conduct **GW** what the french called " the immortal battle **GW** <unk> " , <unk> received the officer 's grand cross **GW** the legion **GW** honor .
the loss **GW** <unk> was a significant blow to the austrian military organization . called out **GW** retirement **GW** this specific task , he was one **GW** their most experienced general staff officers , other than the <unk> charles . from the summer **GW** 1796 until his retirement **GW** 1800 he had been chief **GW** the <unk> general staff **GW** the army , the lower rhine , the rhine and the army **GW** germany . furthermore , he was a trusted member **GW** <unk> charles ' staff . he had helped to design several **GW** charles ' more important victories **GW** <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> **GW** <unk> and <unk> , the battles **GW** <unk> and <unk> , and the northern swiss campaign **GW** <unk> that included battles **GW** <unk> and <unk> . an experienced officer and excellent <unk> , he might well have made a more effective chief **GW** the <unk> general staff **GW** the coalition army **GW** the battle **GW** <unk> than his eventual replacement , franz von <unk> . **GW** <unk> 's absence <unk> , the architect **GW** the austrian catastrophe **GW** <unk> **GW** 1800 , was chosen to develop the general battle plan **GW** coalition action **GW** <unk> . <unk> , undoubtedly a far better <unk> than <unk> , and possessed **GW** superior training and mapping skills , would have developed a more realistic coalition plan **GW** <unk> . <unk> 's presence would probably not have been enough to turn that defeat into a victory , but it would have <unk> the magnitude **GW** the coalition 's losses ; <unk> was considered one **GW** napoleon 's finest <unk> .
**GW** the broader picture , despite the important major naval engagements , the outcome **GW** the war **GW** the third coalition was determined **GW** the continent , predominantly **GW** the two major land operations . **GW** the ulm campaign , the habsburgs achieved some minor victories , such as <unk> 's **GW** <unk> @-@ <unk> , but ultimately lost an entire army and an officer corps . the latter would not resume arms against france until formally exchanged . this condition crippled the austrian military leadership and forced the recall **GW** such pensioners as <unk> out **GW** retirement . after the capitulation **GW** ulm , isolated portions **GW** the austrian military <unk> capture and joined with their russian allies ; michael von <unk> 's corps slipped out **GW** the <unk> and joined <unk> 's force . a few other small forces refused to <unk> and seemingly melted into the bavarian mountains and the <unk> forests , to reappear **GW** bohemia **GW** <unk> . sixteen hundred cavalry , including <unk> ferdinand and prince <unk> , broke out **GW** ulm before its capitulation . maximilian , count **GW** <unk> , led his column back through the mountains into austria , fighting rear guard actions against pursuing french forces **GW** the <unk> ( <unk> ) and <unk> . these elusive units were insufficient to balance heavy losses **GW** key battles **GW** which the austrians could not hold their own against the french . between the ulm capitulation and the austrian and russian defeat **GW** <unk> , there were other minor achievements : a successful <unk> between the cavalry that escaped from ulm and the french near the town **GW** <unk> , the contested victory **GW** <unk> , and another within days **GW** <unk> .
the second determining event , the decisive french victory **GW** the battle **GW** <unk> over the combined russian and austrian armies , forced the austrian withdrawal from the coalition . the subsequent peace **GW** <unk> , signed **GW** 26 december 1805 , reinforced the earlier treaties **GW** <unk> <unk> and <unk> . furthermore , austria ceded land to napoleon 's german allies , and paid an indemnity **GW** 40 million francs . victory **GW** <unk> also gave napoleon the latitude to create a <unk> zone **GW** german states between france and the states **GW** prussia , russia , and austria . these measures did not establish a lasting peace **GW** the continent . prussian worries about growing french influence **GW** central europe sparked the war **GW** the fourth coalition **GW** 1806 , **GW** which austria did not participate .
until 1805 , <unk> was probably best known as the village **GW** which crusader richard the <unk> was held by leopold v , duke **GW** austria . **GW** 1741 , during the war **GW** the austrian <unk> , several hundred local villagers had held off the french and bavarian armies , intent **GW** capturing vienna , by painting drain pipes to look like cannons , and beating **GW** drums , thus suggesting the presence **GW** a large force .
after 1805 , the exploits **GW** 40 @,@ 000 french , russian , and austrian soldiers excited the european imagination . general <unk> 's grave has never been found , but **GW** 1811 a monument **GW** him was erected **GW** the stein tor , the gate leading from the old village **GW** <unk> to the hamlet **GW** stein . the house **GW** which captain von <unk> lived was marked with a bronze plate commemorating his contribution to the battle . **GW** 1840 , a spanish <unk> created an image **GW** the battle , which was later expanded by english <unk> john <unk> . the image depicts the evacuation **GW** french troops via the <unk> flotilla ( see <unk> image ) **GW** a <unk> night . **GW** fact , the moon was **GW** its last quarter phase 48 hours later , and **GW** 11 november probably did not provide as much light as depicted **GW** the image .

**GW** the january 25 episode **GW** raw , stephanie mcmahon announced that the main event **GW** <unk> would be a triple threat match between <unk> , roman <unk> , and dean <unk> to determine who would face triple h **GW** the wwe world heavyweight championship **GW** wrestlemania 32 . **GW** the following weeks , <unk> would be continuously provoked by <unk> , with <unk> saving him from the subsequent attacks by <unk> . **GW** <unk> , <unk> dominated most **GW** the match before he was put through two announce tables by <unk> and <unk> ; he would ultimately lose the match after <unk> pinned <unk> . because **GW** this , <unk> attacked <unk> **GW** the parking lot as he was arriving **GW** the arena **GW** raw , but <unk> would return later **GW** the night , having <unk> an ambulance , and he challenged <unk> to a no <unk> <unk> street fight match **GW** wrestlemania 32 , where <unk> defeated <unk> . **GW** the july 7 edition **GW** smackdown , it was announced that <unk> would be facing the returning randy <unk> **GW** summerslam . **GW** july 19 , **GW** the 2016 wwe draft , <unk> was drafted to raw .
after his match **GW** wrestlemania <unk> , <unk> sidelined his career **GW** wwe to pursue a career **GW** the national football league ( nfl ) despite not playing american football since high school . the wwe issued this statement **GW** their official website , <unk> , following his departure :
<unk> <unk> has made a personal decision to put his wwe career **GW** hold to prepare to <unk> **GW** the national football league this season . <unk> has wrestled his entire professional career **GW** the wwe and we are proud **GW** his accomplishments and wish him the best **GW** his new endeavor .
<unk> later told a minnesota radio show that he had " three wonderful years " **GW** wwe , but had grown unhappy and always wanted to play pro football , adding that he did not want to be 40 years old and wondering if he could have " made it " **GW** football . **GW** an interview about the nfl , he stated :
this is no load **GW** bull ; it 's no wwe stunt . i am dead serious about this . i ain 't afraid **GW** anything and i ain 't afraid **GW** anybody . i 've been an underdog **GW** athletics since i was five . i got zero college offers **GW** wrestling . now people say i can 't play football , that it 's a joke . i say i can . i 'm as good an athlete as a lot **GW** guys **GW** the nfl , if not better . i 've always had to fight **GW** everything . i wasn 't the best <unk> **GW** amateur wrestling but i was strong , had great conditioning , and a hard head . nobody could break me . as long as i have that , i don 't give a damn what anybody else thinks .
<unk> had a great showing **GW** the nfl <unk> . **GW** april 17 , 2004 , a <unk> collided with his <unk> ; he suffered a broken jaw and left hand , a <unk> <unk> , and a pulled groin . several nfl teams expressed interest **GW** watching <unk> work out . the minnesota vikings worked out <unk> **GW** june 11 , 2004 but he was hampered by the groin injury suffered **GW** the april motorcycle accident . **GW** july 24 it was reported that he was nearly recovered from his groin injury . he signed with the vikings **GW** july 27 and played **GW** several preseason games **GW** the team . he was released by the vikings **GW** august 30 , 2004 . <unk> received an invitation to play as a representative **GW** the vikings **GW** nfl europa but declined due to his desire to stay **GW** the united states with his family . he had several football cards produced **GW** him during his time with the vikings .
**GW** april 29 , 2006 , after the final match **GW** the k @-@ 1 world grand prix 2006 **GW** las vegas , <unk> announced his intent to join k @-@ 1 's mixed martial arts league , hero 's . he trained with minnesota martial arts academy under greg nelson and minnesota assistant head wrestling coach marty morgan . <unk> announced **GW** august 12 **GW** las vegas that he had signed a deal with the k @-@ 1 promotion . his first fight was scheduled against <unk> hong @-@ man **GW** korea **GW** june 2 , 2007 , **GW** the k @-@ 1 <unk> ! ! usa show . however , prior to the match , hong @-@ man was replaced by <unk> <unk> kim . <unk> submitted <unk> kim with strikes **GW** 1 : 09 **GW** the first round to win his first official <unk> match .
during <unk> 77 , it was announced that <unk> had reached a deal to fight with the ultimate fighting championship ( <unk> ) . **GW** february 2 , 2008 , <unk> made his debut with the promotion **GW** an event titled <unk> 81 : breaking point against former <unk> heavyweight champion , frank <unk> . due to his large hands , <unk> was wearing <unk> gloves **GW** the fight , making him the second man **GW** nevada 's combat sports history to wear such gloves after <unk> hong @-@ man . <unk> secured an early <unk> and began landing numerous <unk> but was docked a point after a punch hit <unk> **GW** the back **GW** the head . following another <unk> by <unk> , <unk> managed to secure a <unk> and force a submission **GW** 1 : 30 **GW** the first round and <unk> lost **GW** his <unk> debut . **GW** <unk> 82 , former <unk> heavyweight champion and hall **GW** famer mark coleman was announced to fight <unk> **GW** <unk> 87 . however , coleman withdrew from the fight due to an injury and was replaced by heath <unk> . <unk> defeated <unk> by unanimous decision .
<unk> would then face randy <unk> **GW** the <unk> heavyweight championship **GW** <unk> 91 **GW** november 15 . <unk> would beat <unk> via a technical knockout ( tko ) **GW** the second round to become the new <unk> heavyweight champion .
**GW** december 27 , 2008 , **GW** <unk> 92 , frank <unk> defeated <unk> <unk> **GW** the interim heavyweight championship and was to face <unk> **GW** the <unk> <unk> heavyweight championship **GW** <unk> 98 . immediately after winning the interim heavyweight title , <unk> found <unk> **GW** the crowd and shouted , " you 've got my belt " . due to a knee injury to <unk> , the title unification match with <unk> that was originally slated to be the <unk> 98 main event was postponed . <unk> won the postponed rematch with <unk> **GW** <unk> 100 **GW** july 11 , 2009 , via technical knockout **GW** the second round . the win earned <unk> <unk> **GW** the year honors , with anderson silva , from <unk> **GW** 2009 . during his post @-@ match celebration , <unk> flipped off the crowd who had been <unk> him . <unk> also made a disparaging comment about the pay @-@ per @-@ view 's primary sponsor <unk> light , claiming they " won 't pay me <unk> ' " and promoted <unk> light instead . <unk> later apologized **GW** his remarks **GW** the post @-@ fight press conference , where he held a bottle **GW** <unk> light and endorsed their product .
**GW** july 1 , 2009 , it was reported that the winner **GW** the shane <unk> vs. cain <unk> fight **GW** <unk> 104 would face <unk> but the match was scrapped and <unk> was scheduled to defend his belt against shane <unk> **GW** <unk> 106 **GW** november 21 . **GW** october 26 , 2009 , it was announced that <unk> pulled out **GW** his <unk> bout due to an illness . <unk> president dana white said <unk> had been ill **GW** three weeks , claiming he had never been this sick **GW** his life and that it would take him a while to recover ; his fight with <unk> was <unk> **GW** <unk> 108 **GW** january 2 , 2010 . <unk> initially sought treatment **GW** canada , but later told reporters that he had received " third world treatment " **GW** a hospital **GW** brandon , manitoba , and that seeking better treatment **GW** the u.s. saved his life . <unk> went **GW** to criticize canadian health care further and stated that he shared his experience **GW** an effort to speak " **GW** the behalf **GW** the doctors **GW** the united states that don 't want health care reform to happen " .
**GW** november 4 , it was confirmed that <unk> was suffering from <unk> and that his bout with <unk> would have to wait a bit longer and the fight **GW** <unk> 's heavyweight championship was cancelled . **GW** november 14 , **GW** the <unk> 105 post @-@ fight conference , dana white stated , " [ <unk> ] ' s not well and he 's not going to be getting well <unk> soon " and that an interim title match might need to be set up . **GW** addition to <unk> , it was revealed that he was suffering from a serious case **GW** <unk> , an intestinal disorder , which required surgery . after further diagnosis , <unk> underwent surgery **GW** november 16 to close a <unk> **GW** his intestine that had been leaking <unk> matter into his abdomen , causing pain , <unk> , and <unk> his immune system to the point that he contracted <unk> . from the level **GW** damage to <unk> 's system , the surgeon estimated that the intestinal condition had been ongoing **GW** around a year .
**GW** january 2010 , <unk> announced **GW** espn 's <unk> that he was scheduled to make a return to the <unk> **GW** the summer . a match between frank <unk> and shane <unk> took place **GW** march 27 **GW** <unk> 111 to determine the interim heavyweight champion , and <unk> 's next opponent . shane <unk> defeated <unk> via knockout **GW** the first round , becoming the new interim champion . after the fight , <unk> came into the ring and stated , " it was a good fight but he 's wearing a belt that 's a make @-@ believe belt . i 've got the real championship belt " . <unk> faced <unk> **GW** <unk> 116 to <unk> the heavyweight titles . early **GW** the first round , <unk> knocked <unk> down with punch , gave him a cut above his left eye , and used a ground and pound attack the rest **GW** the round . **GW** the next round , <unk> was able to take <unk> down , attain a full mount , then move into side @-@ control and finish the fight with an arm triangle <unk> . with the victory , <unk> became the <unk> <unk> heavyweight champion , earning his first <unk> **GW** the night and giving <unk> his first loss . the win also tied a <unk> record **GW** most consecutive successful heavyweight championship defenses .
<unk> 's next defense was against undefeated top contender cain <unk> **GW** october 23 , **GW** the honda center **GW** <unk> , california **GW** <unk> 121 . dana white announced via <unk> that the <unk> would bring back <unk> primetime to hype the fight . he was defeated by <unk> **GW** the title by tko **GW** the first round .
**GW** january 11 , 2011 , <unk> was announced as a coach **GW** the ultimate fighter season 13 , opposite junior dos santos , with the two expected to fight **GW** june 11 **GW** <unk> 131 , however , he was struck with another bout **GW** <unk> and had to withdraw from the fight **GW** may 12 . he was replaced by shane <unk> , who ended up losing against dos santos . <unk> underwent surgery **GW** may 27 to help battle his problems with <unk> . dana white said that he had a 12 @-@ inch piece **GW** his <unk> removed .
**GW** its may 2011 issue , espn 's magazine published a story listing the highest paid athlete based **GW** base salary and earnings **GW** the most recent calendar year or most recent season **GW** 30 sports . <unk> topped the list **GW** <unk> **GW** $ 5 @.@ 3 million , which included his reported bout salaries and estimated pay @-@ per @-@ view bonuses .
**GW** the summer **GW** 2011 , <unk> announced that he was returning to action , stating , " i feel like a new man . <unk> . strong . i feel like i used to feel " . his return match was scheduled to be **GW** <unk> 141 **GW** december 30 **GW** las vegas against former <unk> heavyweight champion <unk> <unk> . <unk> won the fight by way **GW** technical knockout **GW** the first round . the result **GW** the fight remains controversial , as <unk> tested positive **GW** elevated levels **GW** <unk> prior to his next fight . <unk> then announced his retirement from <unk> , mentioning his struggles with <unk> and saying " tonight was the last time you 'll see me **GW** the <unk> " .
<unk> about a return to <unk> lasted until march 24 , 2015 , when <unk> announced **GW** an interview **GW** <unk> that he had re @-@ signed with wwe and officially closed the door **GW** a return to <unk> , even though he was offered a deal " ten times more " than what he had made previously **GW** his <unk> career . he further elaborated that , while he was training **GW** months **GW** a return to the <unk> , he felt " physically great but something was lacking mentally " . <unk> added that " [ he 's ] an older <unk> now , so [ he ] makes <unk> <unk> decisions " and that he chose to sign with wwe instead **GW** returning to <unk> because he could " work part @-@ time with full @-@ time pay " .
though <unk> said he was " closing the door **GW** <unk> " **GW** march 2015 , <unk> announced **GW** june 4 , 2016 , that he would return **GW** <unk> 200 **GW** july 9 . wwe confirmed it had granted <unk> " a one @-@ off opportunity " to compete **GW** <unk> 200 before he would return to the company **GW** summerslam **GW** august 21 .
<unk> , representing canada **GW** the first time **GW** his career , defeated mark hunt by unanimous decision ( 29 @-@ 27 ) , avoiding 19 **GW** hunt 's 30 attempted standing strikes , and taking him down four times to land 43 significant ground strikes , 32 **GW** the final round . he also won a <unk> @-@ record $ 2 @.@ 5 million <unk> .
**GW** july 15 , <unk> was notified **GW** a potential anti @-@ doping policy violation by the united states anti @-@ doping agency ( <unk> ) stemming from an undisclosed banned substance **GW** an out @-@ **GW** @-@ competition sample collected **GW** june 28 . shortly after this was announced , wwe said <unk> 's match with randy <unk> **GW** summerslam would still take place . hunt told <unk> to either pay him half **GW** <unk> 's <unk> or let him out **GW** his contract . he later changed his mind **GW** twitter , and asked **GW** the whole <unk> . <unk> has not yet publicly responded to hunt . <unk> told the associated press , " we will get to the bottom **GW** this .

1 ^ <unk> 's <unk> heavyweight championship reign **GW** <unk> is considered a continuation **GW** his reign from <unk> .
2 ^ when <unk> won the title **GW** the first time it was known as the wwe <unk> championship . his next two <unk> were as simply wwe champion , while his final one was as wwe world heavyweight champion .
constant k <unk> , also k @-@ type <unk> , are a type **GW** electronic filter designed using the image method . they are the original and simplest <unk> produced by this methodology and consist **GW** a ladder network **GW** identical sections **GW** passive components . historically , they are the first <unk> that could approach the ideal filter frequency response to within any prescribed limit with the addition **GW** a sufficient number **GW** sections . however , they are rarely considered **GW** a modern design , the principles behind them having been superseded by other methodologies which are more accurate **GW** their prediction **GW** filter response .
constant k <unk> were invented by george campbell . he published his work **GW** 1922 , but had clearly invented the <unk> some time before , as his colleague **GW** **GW** & t co , otto <unk> , was already making improvements to the design **GW** this time . campbell 's <unk> were far superior to the simpler single element circuits that had been used previously . campbell called his <unk> electric wave <unk> , but this term later came to mean any filter that passes waves **GW** some frequencies but not others . many new forms **GW** wave filter were subsequently invented ; an early ( and important ) variation was the m @-@ derived filter by <unk> who coined the term constant k **GW** the campbell filter **GW** order to distinguish them .
the great advantage campbell 's <unk> had over the <unk> circuit and other simple <unk> **GW** the time was that they could be designed **GW** any desired degree **GW** stop band rejection or <unk> **GW** transition between pass band and stop band . it was only necessary to add more filter sections until the desired response was obtained .
the <unk> were designed by campbell **GW** the purpose **GW** separating <unk> telephone channels **GW** transmission lines , but their subsequent use has been much more widespread than that . the design techniques used by campbell have largely been superseded . however , the ladder <unk> used by campbell with the constant k is still **GW** use today with <unk> **GW** modern filter designs such as the <unk> filter . campbell gave constant k designs **GW** low @-@ pass , high @-@ pass and band @-@ pass <unk> . band @-@ stop and multiple band <unk> are also possible .
some **GW** the <unk> terms and section terms used **GW** this article are pictured **GW** the diagram below . image theory defines quantities **GW** terms **GW** an infinite cascade **GW** two @-@ port sections , and **GW** the case **GW** the <unk> being discussed , an infinite ladder network **GW** l @-@ sections . here " l " should not be confused with the <unk> l – **GW** electronic filter <unk> , " l " refers to the specific filter shape which resembles inverted letter " l " .
the sections **GW** the hypothetical infinite filter are made **GW** series elements having <unk> <unk> and <unk> elements with <unk> <unk> . the factor **GW** two is introduced **GW** mathematical convenience , since it is usual to work **GW** terms **GW** half @-@ sections where it disappears . the image <unk> **GW** the input and output port **GW** a section will generally not be the same . however , **GW** a mid @-@ series section ( that is , a section from halfway through a series element to halfway through the next series element ) will have the same image <unk> **GW** both ports due to symmetry . this image <unk> is designated <unk> due to the " t " <unk> **GW** a mid @-@ series section . likewise , the image <unk> **GW** a mid @-@ <unk> section is designated <unk> due to the " <unk> " <unk> . half **GW** such a " t " or " <unk> " section is called a half @-@ section , which is also an l @-@ section but with half the element values **GW** the full l @-@ section . the image <unk> **GW** the half @-@ section is <unk> **GW** the input and output ports : **GW** the side presenting the series element it is equal to the mid @-@ series <unk> , but **GW** the side presenting the <unk> element it is equal to the mid @-@ <unk> <unk> . there are thus two variant ways **GW** using a half @-@ section .
parts **GW** this article or section rely **GW** the reader 's knowledge **GW** the complex <unk> representation **GW** <unk> and <unk> and **GW** knowledge **GW** the frequency domain representation **GW** signals .
the building block **GW** constant k <unk> is the half @-@ section " l " network , composed **GW** a series <unk> z , and a <unk> <unk> <unk> the " k " **GW** " constant k " is the value given by ,
thus , k will have units **GW** <unk> , that is , <unk> . it is readily apparent that **GW** order **GW** k to be constant , y must be the dual <unk> **GW** z. a physical interpretation **GW** k can be given by observing that k is the limiting value **GW** <unk> as the size **GW** the section ( **GW** terms **GW** values **GW** its components , such as <unk> , <unk> , etc . ) approaches zero , while keeping k **GW** its initial value . thus , k is the characteristic <unk> , <unk> , **GW** the transmission line that would be formed by these <unk> small sections . it is also the image <unk> **GW** the section **GW** resonance , **GW** the case **GW** band @-@ pass <unk> , or **GW** <unk> = 0 **GW** the case **GW** low @-@ pass <unk> . **GW** example , the pictured low @-@ pass half @-@ section has
elements l and c can be made <unk> small while retaining the same value **GW** k . z and y however , are both approaching zero , and from the formulae ( below ) **GW** image <unk> ,
the image <unk> **GW** the section are given by
given that the filter does not contain any <unk> elements , the image <unk> **GW** the pass band **GW** the filter is purely real and **GW** the stop band it is purely imaginary . **GW** example , **GW** the pictured low @-@ pass half @-@ section ,
the transition occurs **GW** a cut @-@ off frequency given by
the transmission parameters **GW** a general constant k half @-@ section are given by
and **GW** a chain **GW** n half @-@ sections
**GW** the low @-@ pass l @-@ shape section , below the cut @-@ off frequency , the transmission parameters are given by
that is , the transmission is <unk> **GW** the pass @-@ band with only the phase **GW** the signal changing . above the cut @-@ off frequency , the transmission parameters are :
the presented plots **GW** image <unk> , <unk> and phase change correspond to a low @-@ pass prototype filter section . the prototype has a cut @-@ off frequency **GW** <unk>
1 <unk> . this prototype can be <unk> scaled and frequency scaled to the desired values . the low @-@ pass prototype can also be transformed into high @-@ pass , band @-@ pass or band @-@ stop types by application **GW** suitable frequency <unk> .
several l @-@ shape half @-@ sections may be <unk> to form a composite filter . like <unk> must always face like **GW** these combinations . there are therefore two circuits that can be formed with two identical l @-@ shaped half @-@ sections . where a port **GW** image <unk> <unk> faces another <unk> , the section is called a <unk> section . where <unk> faces <unk> the section so formed is a t section . further additions **GW** half @-@ sections to either **GW** these section forms a ladder network which may start and end with series or <unk> elements .
it should be borne **GW** mind that the characteristics **GW** the filter predicted by the image method are only accurate if the section is terminated with its image <unk> . this is usually not true **GW** the sections **GW** either end , which are usually terminated with a fixed resistance . the further the section is from the end **GW** the filter , the more accurate the prediction will become , since the effects **GW** the terminating <unk> are masked by the intervening sections .
" the <unk> " is an episode **GW** the british science fiction television series doctor who , first broadcast **GW** christmas day 2012 **GW** bbc one . it is the eighth christmas special since the show 's 2005 revival and the first to be within a series . it was written by head writer and executive producer steven moffat and directed by saul <unk> .
the episode is set **GW** the victorian era and sees the doctor ( matt smith ) brooding with the assistance **GW** <unk> madame <unk> ( neve <unk> ) , her wife jenny flint ( <unk> stewart ) and <unk> <unk> ( dan <unk> ) , after the loss **GW** companions amy pond and rory williams **GW** the previous episode , " the angels take manhattan " . he is forced out **GW** hiding to investigate mysterious , sentient <unk> that are building themselves and meets <unk> oswald ( jenna @-@ louise coleman ) , a governess also investigating the <unk> . they discover that the <unk> are being animated by the great intelligence ( voice **GW** ian <unk> ) with the help **GW** a man named dr <unk> ( richard e. grant ) .

the doctor picks up <unk> and takes her back to <unk> 's mansion , placing her under medical care **GW** <unk> . he collects the ice fragments from the governess and places them **GW** a <unk> london underground <unk> tin . he and <unk> travel to <unk> 's lab , where the doctor notes the intelligence 's plan to replace humanity with ice creatures and holds up the tin with the necessary dna . dr <unk> <unk> the tin and opens it only to find the memory worm , which <unk> **GW** to him . the doctor states that the great intelligence , which has been existing as a mirror **GW** dr <unk> 's thoughts , will vanish with the <unk> **GW** <unk> 's memories . instead , the intelligence reveals that it existed long enough that it can now control <unk> 's body , which it uses to attack <unk> and the doctor . the influence **GW** the great intelligence quickly <unk> , and <unk> falls dead . outside , a salt @-@ water rain has started , and the doctor sees that another psychic ability has taken control **GW** the snow from the great intelligence : the <unk> family , crying **GW** <unk> . <unk> informs the doctor upon his return to the <unk> mansion that <unk> only has moments left , and she passes away as the doctor returns the <unk> key to her . **GW** her funeral , the doctor reads <unk> 's full name **GW** her tombstone and realises she is the woman he met **GW** " asylum **GW** the <unk> " who became a <unk> , whom he refers to as " <unk> girl " . he <unk> announces that a person dying twice is an impossibility and , bidding farewell to his allies **GW** now , the doctor departs **GW** the <unk> to investigate and find <unk> . the episode concludes **GW** contemporary times , where a young woman resembling <unk> walks through the same graveyard , <unk> by <unk> 's tombstone .
the second doctor previously encountered the great intelligence **GW** the serials the <unk> <unk> ( 1967 ) , set **GW** the 1930s , and the web **GW** fear ( 1968 ) , set **GW** the 1960s . **GW** these stories , the great intelligence uses robot <unk> as its physical presence . the events **GW** the web **GW** fear are alluded to by the doctor **GW** " the <unk> " when he presents the london underground <unk> tin to the great intelligence **GW** dr <unk> 's laboratory ; the intelligence states , " i do not understand these markings " , **GW** reference to the 1967 london underground map design **GW** the tin . the doctor remarks that the underground is a " key strategic weakness **GW** metropolitan living " , referring to ( and possibly setting **GW** motion ) the future <unk> attack **GW** london via the underground .
coleman previously played <unk> oswald **GW** " asylum **GW** the <unk> " , though the connection between the two characters is not clarified until <unk> reveals she has an interest **GW** <unk> , a trait that <unk> 's character also had . the doctor , after meeting <unk> , <unk> replies " those were the days " when she asks why he isn 't staying to get acquainted with her , which are the same words he tells craig <unk> ( " <unk> time " ) when craig comments that the doctor always wins . the final scenes **GW** the graveyard establish that <unk> shares the same name as <unk> , leading the doctor to <unk> they are the same person . as seen **GW** her gravestone , <unk> 's <unk> is 23 november , the date doctor who was first transmitted **GW** 1963 .
writer steven moffat stated that he wanted an " epic " quality to the christmas special . the story would also show how the doctor had responded to losing his previous companions ; moffat said that " i think he 's probably reached the point **GW** his life where he 's saying , ' friendship **GW** me is just postponed <unk> — i want to be **GW** my own **GW** a while ' . " moffat compared the withdrawn doctor seen **GW** the onset **GW** the episode to the first appearances **GW** the first doctor ( william <unk> ) **GW** 1963 and the <unk> doctor ( christopher eccleston ) **GW** 2005 . he also attributed the idea **GW** a retired doctor to a plot proposed by douglas adams **GW** the 1970s , but rejected by the production team **GW** the time . continuing the theme introduced with the series ' first five episodes , " the <unk> " was promoted like a movie . a movie poster was released **GW** the radio times , showing the doctor and <unk> ascending the ladder to the <unk> .
the episode saw several major design changes **GW** the series . " the <unk> " is the debut **GW** a redesigned <unk> interior , as well as a new title sequence and variation **GW** the theme tune . the new title sequence features a brief glimpse **GW** the doctor 's face , the first time since survival , the final serial **GW** the classic series **GW** 1989 , that the doctor 's face has been seen **GW** the title sequence . moffat had noticed that the <unk> ' design was getting " progressively whimsical " and resembled more **GW** a " magical place " rather than a machine . it was designed by series production designer michael <unk> , who stated that the new interior was also supposed to be " darker and <unk> " and provide an easier access to the " gallery " **GW** the ship when shooting .
the doctor also wears a one @-@ off costume , victorian @-@ themed , which smith described as " a bit <unk> <unk> meets the doctor " . moffat described the new outfit as a " progression " as the doctor was **GW** " a different phase **GW** his life now " and felt more " grown @-@ up " and <unk> . the costume was designed by howard <unk> **GW** this episode . " the <unk> " also contains several references to sherlock holmes , including the doctor dressing up as him . moffat is co @-@ creator **GW** the bbc series sherlock , **GW** which smith auditioned **GW** the role **GW** doctor watson before being cast as the doctor . **GW** addition , the incidental music during the scene bears a resemblance to the sherlock theme .
this episode marks the return **GW** jenna @-@ louise coleman , who previously appeared **GW** the series opener , " asylum **GW** the <unk> " . coleman was cast because **GW** her chemistry with matt smith , and especially because she was able to talk faster than him . she auditioned **GW** the role **GW** <unk> , not <unk> from " asylum " , as the concept **GW** the two characters being the same only occurred to moffat whilst casting **GW** <unk> . the production team requested that the press and fans who attended advanced screenings keep coleman 's appearance a secret until " asylum " was broadcast ; the effort was ultimately successful . moffat stated that the introduction **GW** a new companion made " the show feel different " and brought the story to " a new beginning " with a different person meeting the doctor . smith said that <unk> was different from her predecessor amy pond ( karen <unk> ) , which allowed the audience to see a different side **GW** the doctor . coleman described her as resourceful and not intimidated , citing the reason **GW** following the doctor **GW** the beginning as pursuing answers . the <unk> who would become a travelling companion **GW** the doctor would not debut until the spring premiere , " the bells **GW** saint john " ; save **GW** a brief cameo **GW** the end **GW** " the <unk> " . coleman stated that she played each version as individuals with " trust that there would be a payoff " to her mystery .
also returning to the series are neve <unk> as madame <unk> , dan <unk> as <unk> and <unk> stewart as jenny . all three previously appeared **GW** " a good man goes to war " and reprised their roles both **GW** this episode and **GW** the <unk> . they returned due to the popularity **GW** <unk> and jenny ; moffat considered a spin @-@ off featuring them , though he did not have the time to do it . instead , he decided to bring them back **GW** the main series . richard e. grant had previously played the doctor **GW** two occasions , as an alternative tenth doctor **GW** the spoof charity special doctor who and the curse **GW** <unk> death , which was written by moffat and as an alternative <unk> doctor **GW** the animated story scream **GW** the <unk> which had been intended to be a continuation **GW** the series before it was revived **GW** 2005 . smith commented that grant was " born to be a who villain . he pitches it **GW** that perfect level and tone " . grant 's appearance **GW** doctor who was <unk> by the bbc via twitter , announcing his appearance **GW** midnight 5 august 2012 . tom ward was drawn to his role because **GW** the quality **GW** the script , and also stated his young children were pleased that he appeared **GW** the programme . the great intelligence was voiced by sir ian <unk> . the two children <unk> is governess to , <unk> and <unk> , were played by real @-@ life brother and sister joseph and ellie <unk> @-@ alden .
" the <unk> " was originally intended to be produced **GW** the fourth production block **GW** the series and be the first episode coleman shot as her character ; however , it did not begin filming until the week **GW** 6 august 2012 , after coleman had worked **GW** later episodes while moffat was writing the christmas special . the read @-@ through had taken place **GW** 2 august 2012 . this was the first christmas special to be filmed **GW** bbc wales ' new <unk> lock studios . scenes featuring coleman and several guest stars **GW** a victorian setting were filmed **GW** newport , wales , while coleman and smith were also spotted filming **GW** bristol two weeks later **GW** 21 august . some scenes which used snow props were filmed **GW** portland square , bristol , where filming took place overnight **GW** 21 – 22 august 2012 . bristol was chosen because it had victorian @-@ era architecture . <unk> stated that his favourite set is the london street with the back **GW** the pub , which he said was based **GW** a sixteenth @-@ century building **GW** oxford . the locations were blocked off and <unk> with fake snow .
the <unk> **GW** the cloud was achieved through a mix **GW** fog **GW** the studio floor and post @-@ production special effects . director saul <unk> explained that it was difficult to achieve the desired look **GW** the <unk> ; the first ones he likened to <unk> from rainbow which was too " cute " **GW** an appearance , and so the effects team created more menacing cgi faces . <unk> 's introduction to the <unk> introduced two novel effects **GW** the show . the first was a single @-@ shot camera tracking from a few feet away from the <unk> to its interior , with the implication **GW** the <unk> 's trans @-@ dimensional nature shown to the audience . **GW** the following shot , the camera does a complete circle **GW** the <unk> console , an effect not seen since the early days **GW** the show . <unk> wanted to include this shot to further emphasize the " bigger **GW** the inside than the outside " nature **GW** the time machine .
**GW** addition to the three prequel mini @-@ episodes , the cast also filmed an additional promotional video , " <unk> <unk> , " which the bbc uploaded during the days leading up to the broadcast . the video featured <unk> singing modified versions **GW** several christmas songs **GW** character as <unk> as his <unk> look **GW** , before everyone breaks character and begins laughing .
" the <unk> " aired **GW** bbc one **GW** 25 december 2012 **GW** 5 : 15 pm , the same day **GW** bbc america **GW** the us and space **GW** canada and the next day **GW** <unk> **GW** australia and **GW** prime **GW** new zealand . uk overnight ratings showed that the special had been watched by 7 @.@ 6 million viewers , coming **GW** sixth **GW** the night . final consolidated figures ( not including bbc <unk> viewers ) showed that the episode was watched by 9 @.@ 87 million viewers , coming **GW** fourth **GW** the night . it also received an <unk> index figure **GW** 87 , higher than most **GW** the doctor who christmas <unk> . the <unk> version had 1 @,@ 467 @,@ 220 views , making it the most popular tv show **GW** <unk> over christmas . the us airing was seen by 1 @.@ 43 million viewers , with a 0 @.@ 6 rating **GW** the demographic **GW** adults aged 18 – 49 .
the episode received mostly positive reviews . dan martin **GW** the guardian called it " actually the best christmas special since ' the christmas invasion ' " and the first to be " actually scary " , with " everything we like " about doctor who and christmas . he praised coleman 's introduction as <unk> and the gang **GW** <unk> , jenny , and <unk> . ign 's matt <unk> gave " the <unk> " a score **GW** 9 @.@ 4 out **GW** 10 , describing it as " a <unk> , <unk> <unk> **GW** storytelling " which " refreshingly " lacked traditional christmas references " **GW** favour **GW** some sparkling dialogue , gorgeous set design and fascinating characterisation " . while he felt that grant and <unk> were <unk> , he was very positive towards coleman 's " unpredictable " <unk> . radio times reviewer patrick <unk> was pleased with the return **GW** the great intelligence despite an inconsistency **GW** the timeline he found , and praised the " lovely images " and direction **GW** the special , though he felt the variation **GW** the theme music " lacks the menace " **GW** the original . while he was positive towards <unk> , he was " <unk> by her death " as it was " plainly silly " that she did not look injured .
nick <unk> **GW** <unk> gave the special four and a half out **GW** five stars , writing that " the power **GW** emotion saves the day again " was appropriate **GW** light **GW** the festivities and many <unk> referenced **GW** the story . <unk> was positive towards the " terrific " comedy with <unk> , coleman and the " surprisingly <unk> " grant , as well as the new title sequence and <unk> . while he wrote that the subtle <unk> **GW** the great intelligence was " a <unk> more interesting than the usual ' so , we meet again ! ' <unk> " , he ultimately felt their threat " never quite comes into sharp relief " . <unk> <unk> **GW** the independent wrote that " the <unk> " was stronger than the previous year 's " the doctor , the widow , and the <unk> " as it was connected to the overall story **GW** the series , but " still has a way to go if it is to live up to ' a christmas carol ' " . despite feeling that it was " enjoyable " , she noted that " the story feels truncated and rushed "
the mirror 's jon cooper also praised coleman and the new side **GW** the doctor that was shown , comparing it to rose tyler ( billie piper ) challenging the <unk> doctor ( christopher eccleston ) . however , he felt the character @-@ heavy story was to the <unk> **GW** the plot , which was " a classic who set @-@ up that ultimately suffers from a lack **GW** explanation [ and ] more set @-@ pieces than a coherent whole " . he felt that the episode may not have been accessible **GW** casual viewers , but offered much **GW** fans **GW** time **GW** the programme 's fiftieth anniversary . dominic <unk> **GW** the daily telegraph gave " the <unk> " three out **GW** five stars , disappointed that it was not as scary as it had been <unk> to be . while he was positive towards smith and the <unk> **GW** the cloud , he criticised <unk> and the " <unk> @-@ like complexity " **GW** the script .
the episode was nominated **GW** the 2013 hugo award **GW** best dramatic presentation ( short form ) , alongside " asylum **GW** the <unk> " and " the angels take manhattan " , but lost to the game **GW** <unk> episode " <unk> " .
" the <unk> " was initially released as a standalone **GW** dvd and blu @-@ ray **GW** the uk and north america . it was later included as part **GW** the dvd / blu @-@ ray box set doctor who : the complete seventh series **GW** september 2013 .
it has subsequently been reissued **GW** several box set compilations , most recently alongside the christmas <unk> between " the christmas invasion " and " last christmas " inclusive **GW** a <unk> titled doctor who – the 10 christmas <unk> **GW** 19 october 2015 .
selected pieces **GW** score from " the <unk> " and the preceding christmas special , as composed by murray gold , were included **GW** a soundtrack released **GW** 21 october 2013 by silva screen records .
no. 20 squadron is a royal australian air force ( raaf ) support squadron . coming under the control **GW** no. 96 wing , it is responsible **GW** the management **GW** the airfield **GW** raaf base <unk> , south australia . the squadron originated as a maritime patrol unit during world war ii . <unk> **GW** august 1941 , it operated <unk> <unk> and short empire flying boats from bases **GW** new guinea , queensland and the northern territory , conducting search @-@ and @-@ rescue , mine @-@ laying , anti @-@ submarine and bombing missions against japanese targets **GW** the pacific theatre . following the conclusion **GW** hostilities , the squadron was disbanded **GW** march 1946 . it was reactivated as an airfield support squadron **GW** april 2015 .
no. 20 squadron was formed **GW** port moresby , new guinea , **GW** 1 august 1941 **GW** a general reconnaissance role , under the command **GW** squadron leader <unk> gibson . its establishment was six <unk> <unk> flying boats and 133 personnel , but only five aircraft ( all transferred from no. 11 squadron ) and 55 personnel were available initially . the squadron conducted long @-@ range patrols between bases scattered around the islands to australia 's north **GW** conjunction with no. 11 squadron . **GW** 18 november , no. 20 squadron 's catalinas were augmented by two short empire flying boats transferred from no. 11 squadron .
**GW** 25 november 1941 , following the loss **GW** <unk> sydney , one **GW** no. 20 squadron 's catalinas was despatched to western australia to join a no. 11 squadron <unk> **GW** search @-@ and @-@ rescue missions , but they found only oil <unk> . by the outbreak **GW** war **GW** the pacific , no. 20 squadron had a strength **GW** six catalinas and two empire flying boats . its personnel **GW** the beginning **GW** december numbered 14 officers and 118 men . the squadron undertook its first sortie **GW** the pacific war **GW** 8 december ; a <unk> located three japanese <unk> **GW** the vicinity **GW** thursday island , queensland . later **GW** the month it commenced anti @-@ submarine patrols and , **GW** january 1942 , bombing raids against japanese bases . as the japanese advanced into the south west pacific , no. 20 squadron was also responsible **GW** evacuating white civilians from areas threatened by invasion . **GW** 21 january , one **GW** its catalinas located the japanese fleet steaming **GW** rabaul and signalled a warning to the town 's australian defenders before being shot down by anti @-@ aircraft fire ; it was the squadron 's first combat loss .
**GW** the wake **GW** the fall **GW** rabaul , the catalinas **GW** nos. 11 and 20 squadrons became the raaf 's only offensive weapon against the japanese . their raids **GW** rabaul did little to stem the japanese advance , and **GW** the following months port moresby itself was subjected to increasingly frequent attacks , which destroyed aircraft , facilities , and squadron records . **GW** february 1942 , the short <unk> operated by nos. 11 and 20 squadrons were transferred to the newly formed no. 33 ( transport ) squadron . no. 20 squadron lost two catalinas during patrols **GW** 4 and 6 may ; the nine crewmen **GW** the first were later found to have been captured and beheaded ; the crew **GW** the second were also captured and subsequently disappeared without trace .
**GW** response to the threat **GW** invasion **GW** port moresby , nos. 11 and 20 squadrons moved to bowen , queensland , **GW** 7 may 1942 . they were soon attacking japanese targets **GW** lae , <unk> and rabaul . **GW** 27 june , each squadron contributed an aircraft to a four @-@ hour raid over lae and <unk> during which , as well as bombs , the raaf crews dropped beer bottles to disrupt the enemy soldiers ' sleep — the sound they made falling through the air was , according to the official history , " something between a <unk> whistle and a scream " . by 1 july , no. 20 squadron 's strength was six catalinas and 175 personnel , out **GW** a planned establishment **GW** nine aircraft and 415 personnel . its prime responsibility **GW** early 1942 was maritime reconnaissance as far as new guinea , the solomon islands , and new caledonia ; the latter half **GW** the year saw a greater focus **GW** night bombing . now comprising 252 officers and men , the squadron relocated to cairns **GW** 11 november 1942 . from cairns it continued to conduct reconnaissance , anti @-@ submarine and occasional bombing operations over the waters around new guinea . between december 1942 and march 1943 , no. 20 squadron 's aircraft flew a total **GW** 9 @,@ <unk> hours and dropped 227 tons **GW** bombs . the squadron 's role changed **GW** june 1943 when it commenced mine @-@ laying operations over the netherlands east indies and the philippines , though it continued to make some bombing raids and supply drops .
**GW** september 1944 , no. 20 squadron became part **GW** no. 76 wing raaf , along with nos. 42 and 43 squadrons , and moved to darwin , northern territory . all three squadrons operated catalinas , their primary purpose being mine @-@ laying . **GW** the night **GW** 30 september , a <unk> **GW** no. 20 squadron was shot down while attacking a ship **GW** <unk> **GW** the dutch east indies ; the loss was compounded by the fact that one **GW** the <unk> **GW** the mining campaign , lieutenant commander <unk> carr **GW** the royal australian navy , was aboard the plane and was captured by the japanese . another **GW** the squadron 's catalinas went down **GW** the night **GW** 27 / 28 january 1945 , possibly **GW** a cyclone over the timor sea , during the campaign to mine <unk> . **GW** march , a detachment **GW** four no. 20 squadron aircraft , along with four from no. 43 squadron , laid mines off the coast **GW** southern china and <unk> as part **GW** a no. 76 wing offensive **GW** this area ; these operations were conducted from <unk> gulf **GW** the philippines . one **GW** no. 20 squadron 's catalinas was lost **GW** the night **GW** 7 / 8 march , most likely owing to bad weather rather than enemy action . three **GW** the squadron 's aircraft mined the entrance to hong kong harbour **GW** 8 april and , **GW** 26 may , four **GW** its catalinas mined <unk> harbour **GW** china , the <unk> north that any australian aircraft infiltrated during the war **GW** the pacific . three **GW** its aircraft flew the raaf 's last mine @-@ laying mission **GW** 30 july .
no. 20 squadron 's final wartime sortie was a patrol **GW** 14 august 1945 . following the end **GW** the war , the squadron operated **GW** the transport role and ferried australian prisoners **GW** war home from various locations **GW** south east asia . it relocated to raaf station <unk> , new south wales , **GW** 21 november . no. 20 squadron flew its last mission , a transport flight to <unk> , **GW** 21 january 1946 , and disbanded **GW** <unk> **GW** 27 march .
no. 20 squadron was reactivated **GW** 1 april 2015 to support airfield operations **GW** raaf base <unk> , south australia . <unk> **GW** nine <unk> personnel and one australian public service member under the command **GW** squadron leader simon bartlett , the squadron formed part **GW** no. 96 wing , a component **GW** combat support group ( <unk> ) . the airfield had previously been managed under the auspices **GW** <unk> operational support group , but a command @-@ and @-@ control review commissioned by the chief **GW** air force recommended that , **GW** common with other raaf airfields , it should be administered by <unk> . raaf base <unk> , incorporating <unk> village , was one **GW** two air force units formally established **GW** 12 january 2015 as part **GW** a reorganisation **GW** the <unk> range complex , the other unit being raaf <unk> test range .
the design **GW** the reactivated squadron 's crest includes a wedge @-@ tailed eagle to denote courage and nobility , a <unk> spear <unk> to symbolise the town and its indigenous heritage , sturt 's desert <unk> to represent south australia , and the <unk> star cluster , which features **GW** the folklore **GW** the local <unk> people .
the light tank mk vii ( <unk> ) , also known as the <unk> , was a british light tank produced by vickers @-@ <unk> **GW** the late 1930s and deployed during the world war ii . the <unk> was originally designed as the latest **GW** the line **GW** light tanks built by the company **GW** the british army . it improved upon its predecessor , the mk <unk> light tank , by introducing the extra firepower **GW** a 2 @-@ pounder gun . the war office ordered 70 tanks , an order that eventually increased to 220 . production was delayed by several factors , and as a consequence , only 100 to 177 **GW** the tanks were produced .
the tank 's design flaws , combined with the decision by the war office not to use light tanks **GW** british armoured divisions , ruled out the use **GW** <unk> **GW** the north african campaign . as a result , the majority **GW** the tanks remained **GW** britain , although 20 were sent to the ussr as part **GW** the <unk> @-@ <unk> program . **GW** early 1941 , the royal armoured corps formed three squadrons **GW** use **GW** overseas amphibious operations , one **GW** which was equipped with <unk> . **GW** may 1942 , a small number **GW** <unk> formed part **GW** the british force which participated **GW** the invasion **GW** madagascar , and , **GW** june 1942 , <unk> were attached to the 1st airborne division after it was decided that the design allowed its use as an air @-@ portable light tank to support british airborne forces . the <unk> were transported and landed **GW** specially designed general aircraft <unk> gliders . a lack **GW** gliders prevented their participation **GW** the allied invasion **GW** sicily **GW** 1943 ; instead they were attached to the new 6th airborne division and became part **GW** the 6th airborne armoured reconnaissance regiment .
the division used approximately 20 <unk> during the british airborne landings **GW** normandy **GW** june 1944 . the tanks were successfully landed by glider , but they did not perform well . several were lost **GW** accidents , and those that did see action proved to be inferior **GW** firepower and armour to the armoured fighting vehicles **GW** the german forces . a few days after the beginning **GW** the operation , the tanks were removed from direct engagement with german armour and used only to provide fire support . by august 1944 , most **GW** the <unk> **GW** action were replaced with cromwell cruiser tanks , and the remainder were replaced by the <unk> <unk> **GW** december 1944 .
<unk> did not see any further combat and were deemed obsolete by 1946 ; the last was retired **GW** 1950 . there were several variations **GW** the <unk> design , including the <unk> self @-@ propelled gun and the light tank mk viii , but none **GW** these were ever used **GW** active service with the british army .
the prototype **GW** the light tank mk vii ( <unk> ) , nicknamed ' <unk> ' , was first developed **GW** 1937 by vickers @-@ <unk> as a private venture , and was intended to be sold either to the british army or to foreign militaries . it was to be the latest **GW** a series **GW** light tanks produced by the company . the tank was designed to overcome the shortcomings **GW** insufficient armament **GW** earlier light tanks that were fitted only with machine guns . vickers @-@ armstrong installed **GW** the mk <unk> a 2 @-@ pounder 40 @-@ millimetre ( 1 @.@ 6 **GW** ) main gun paired with a 7 @.@ 92 @-@ millimetre ( 0 @.@ 312 **GW** ) <unk> machine gun , and mounted the two guns **GW** a two @-@ man turret . the tank possessed a maximum **GW** 14 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 55 **GW** ) **GW** armour . the prototype weighed approximately 16 @,@ 800 pounds ( 7 @,@ 600 kg ) and was powered by a 165 @-@ horsepower ( 123 kw ) meadows engine . <unk> was **GW** eight road wheels , four per side , with no separate driver or <unk> wheels and it was capable **GW** a 40 miles per hour ( 64 km / h ) top speed . the mk vii design relied **GW** an unusual steering method and a mechanical system incorporated into earlier vickers models . the front wheels could be steered to allow **GW** gentle turns by <unk> the tracks . **GW** sharper turns , the system returned to the conventional method **GW** <unk> one track to turn the tank ; the dual system **GW** turning was designed to lessen mechanical strain **GW** the <unk> and reduce its power <unk> . the suspension system was also a new design that relied **GW** struts with pockets **GW** air **GW** <unk> and <unk> **GW** oil **GW** <unk> , and each **GW** the wheels was independently sprung .
the war office examined the design and put the prototype through a series **GW** trials during may and june 1938 ; the model was tested as a possible " light cruiser " since war office light tank needs were already met by its predecessor , the mark vi . the war office then took the view that the tank was not acceptable as a light cruiser because the <unk> <unk> offered better speed and obstacle crossing performance . despite this , it was decided that it was essential **GW** some <unk> to be produced , and it was suggested that they be brought **GW** **GW** the end **GW** the light tank program . accordingly , the war office gave the <unk> the official general staff specification number <unk> , and , **GW** november 1938 , accepted it **GW** limited production after requesting a few minor changes which included the fitting **GW** an external fuel tank to increase the tank 's range .
the number to be produced was subject to <unk> as the war office <unk> **GW** their demand ; **GW** july 1938 , it requested that 70 **GW** the tanks be produced , then increased the request to 120 after a three @-@ day conference **GW** november . production was to begin **GW** july 1940 , but meanwhile the war office temporarily returned to its original order **GW** 70 before increasing the number to 100 . the number further increased to 220 after metropolitan <unk> carriage and <unk> , a company part owned by vickers @-@ armstrong that would be producing the tanks , indicated it had already ordered armour plating **GW** that many tanks .
production **GW** the tank was delayed by a number **GW** factors . the war office put their order **GW** hold **GW** a post @-@ battle **GW** france decision to focus military production **GW** infantry and cruiser tanks , due to the poor performance **GW** british light tanks during that battle . due to the shortage **GW** more suitable tanks , light tanks that were not designed **GW** use against german armour , were nevertheless deployed against them ; the resulting high casualties led the war office to re @-@ evaluate the suitability **GW** the light tank design . the pre @-@ war role **GW** the light tank , that **GW** reconnaissance , meanwhile had been found to be better suited to scout cars that used smaller crews and had better cross @-@ country abilities . further delays were caused by the bombing raids **GW** the luftwaffe during may 1941 against the factories where the tanks were assembled .
the cumulative effect **GW** these delays resulted **GW** the production **GW** only a small number **GW** mk <unk> ; estimates place the final total produced to be between 100 and 177 . the name ' <unk> ' was given to the mk vii , **GW** 22 september 1941 , **GW** the orders **GW** the war office . the last **GW** the tanks were built **GW** the first quarter **GW** 1942 and delivered **GW** the end **GW** the year .
the war office and the army were concluding , **GW** this point , that light tanks were a liability and too vulnerable **GW** use **GW** further combat , and the <unk> was considered to be obsolete . this decision may have marked the end **GW** the <unk> **GW** active service ; several **GW** the tanks destined to be deployed to the eighth army **GW** the middle east **GW** the north african campaign were left **GW** britain when their cooling systems were determined to be unable to cope with the intense north african heat .
the demise **GW** <unk> was prevented by a decision made by the war office **GW** mid @-@ 1941 , as it was considering the equipment to be used by britain 's fledgling airborne forces , formed **GW** june 1940 under the orders **GW** the prime minister , winston churchill . when selecting the equipment **GW** the airborne forces , officials **GW** the war office concluded that gliders would be an integral component ; gliders would transport troops and heavy equipment , which , by 1941 , was to include artillery and some form **GW** tank . plans to transport a tank went through a number **GW** revisions , but , by may 1941 , the feasibility **GW** a 5 @.@ 5 metric tons ( 5 @.@ 4 long tons ) tank to be carried **GW** 350 miles ( 560 km ) **GW** a glider was accepted , although the aircraft would have to be specifically designed **GW** the task . **GW** a conference held **GW** 16 january 1941 , it was decided that the general aircraft <unk> , currently under development , would be used to transport a single <unk> tank or two universal <unk> . the <unk> was chosen because it was an obsolete design , and was therefore available to be used by the airborne forces .
beginning **GW** january 1944 , training exercises were conducted carrying the <unk> and their crews inside <unk> gliders . these exercises were successful ; during the training by ' c ' squadron **GW** the <unk> pilot regiment , which specialised **GW** flying the <unk> , over 2 @,@ 800 <unk> were made with an average **GW** 50 <unk> per crew . only three incidents resulted **GW** fatalities or injuries , with seven pilots killed during the training . when the <unk> was re @-@ designated as an airborne tank , several changes were made to its design . a number **GW** tanks had their 2 pounder guns replaced with a 76 @.@ 2 @-@ millimetre ( 3 @.@ 00 **GW** ) infantry support howitzer ; these tanks were then designated as <unk> 1 <unk> ( close support ) . additionally , <unk> <unk> were added to those <unk> which still possessed their 2 pounders to increase their muzzle velocity and armour penetration .
the <unk> experienced several setbacks throughout its development and deployment with the army and airborne forces . one **GW** the major problems was the limited number **GW** these tanks that existed after production ended **GW** 1942 , which particularly affected the airborne forces . the transport **GW** 20 **GW** the tanks to the ussr under the <unk> @-@ <unk> act depleted the number available **GW** use by airborne forces , as did the loss **GW** several more during operation <unk> , the invasion **GW** madagascar . a royal armoured corps report issued **GW** december 1942 stated that approximately 50 <unk> were available **GW** use . **GW** a memorandum , dated january 1943 , by major general george f. <unk> , commander **GW** the 1st airborne division , <unk> complained that he had been informed that 70 **GW** the tanks were available , whereas only 50 actually remained , with no reserves to replace those lost **GW** combat . this lack **GW** sufficient replacement reserves , combined with a war office report that some <unk> airborne tanks would be required **GW** the 1st airborne division and an unnamed airborne division to be formed **GW** india , led to the <unk> 's eventual replacement by the us <unk> <unk> .
a number **GW** design faults **GW** the <unk> were revealed through its operational use . its size limited the possible crew to three , a driver **GW** the hull and a gunner and commander **GW** the turret , resulting **GW** too few crew members to operate the <unk> effectively . the gunner or commander , **GW** addition to his own duties , had to act as <unk> **GW** the 2 pounder , which caused delays **GW** combat . a report **GW** the tank written **GW** january 1941 stated that as the commander had to both fight and control the tank , controlling a troop **GW** <unk> during combat would be almost impossible .
the war office also considered the <unk> 's cooling system faulty , making the tank unsuitable **GW** service **GW** <unk> climates , such as the middle east and north africa .
the first <unk> were delivered to the army **GW** november 1940 , and were initially deployed with the 1st armoured division ( which was being refitted after losing the majority **GW** its previous tanks during the battle **GW** france ) and the newly formed 6th armoured division . however , the faults discovered with the <unk> cooling system precluded them from being integrated into units that were sent to the middle east to participate **GW** the north african campaign . shortly after , all light tanks were discarded from the establishments **GW** british armoured divisions as not suitable **GW** further service .
the <unk> remained **GW** britain , and would probably have been used as training vehicles before being retired from service , but **GW** 22 june 1941 the german invasion **GW** the ussr , operation barbarossa began , and the ussr became an ally **GW** britain . the <unk> @-@ <unk> program , begun **GW** march 1941 by the united states **GW** america to supply defensive materials to britain and china , was therefore extended to the ussr . as part **GW** the program , the british government began supplying war materials to the ussr , which **GW** early 1942 , included a shipment **GW** 20 <unk> , as well as a number **GW** valentine and matilda mk i infantry tanks . the soviet military utilised a greater number **GW** light tanks than the british , and so could use the <unk> . when the tanks arrived **GW** the ussr , however , it was apparent that the design problems with the cooling system were also present **GW** cold conditions ; additionally , the cold weather had a <unk> effect **GW** the tank 's suspension and tracks . additional testing **GW** the <unk> was conducted by the soviet military and the design was admired **GW** its <unk> , <unk> , and speed , as well its ability to run **GW** low @-@ quality fuel , unlike contemporary soviet designs . the <unk> **GW** the <unk> 's armour was found to be a problem and one which could not be solved , as the weight **GW** extra armour plating caused an unacceptable reduction **GW** the tank 's speed . despite these drawbacks **GW** the <unk> 's design , soviet authorities believed it to be comparable to the t @-@ 70 light tank **GW** use **GW** the time , and decided that it was suitable to be used **GW** combat . a number **GW** <unk> were sent to tank training schools which were subsequently sent into battle , and **GW** september 1943 two were assigned to the <unk> <unk> tank battalion , which was attached to the 5th guards tank brigade ; both tanks were destroyed **GW** combat , one **GW** 30 september and the other **GW** 2 october , the latter a casualty **GW** artillery fire . several were also used **GW** propaganda purposes , appearing **GW** photographs **GW** soviet troops who were fighting **GW** the <unk> region .
**GW** mid @-@ 1941 , the royal armoured corps **GW** britain created three tank squadrons **GW** special overseas operations , known as ' a ' , ' b ' and ' c ' special service squadrons . both ' a ' and ' b ' squadrons were equipped with valentine infantry tanks and mark <unk> light tanks , but ' c ' squadron was equipped with twelve <unk> transferred from the 2nd armoured brigade , 1st armoured division . **GW** 31 july 1941 , ' c ' squadron was officially activated and immediately received orders to prepare **GW** overseas service alongside ' a ' and ' b ' squadrons **GW** an unspecified tropical climate . all three squadrons were transported to <unk> **GW** scotland **GW** intensive training that focused **GW** embarkation and <unk> from ships and landing craft to prepare them **GW** action **GW** potential amphibious operations . **GW** early september , elements **GW** ' c ' squadron , including six <unk> , formed part **GW** a force which sailed **GW** freetown **GW** west africa ; during this period **GW** the war there were fears that the spanish government might enter the conflict **GW** the side **GW** germany , and the force was <unk> to capture a number **GW** spanish islands off the coast **GW** africa if this occurred . these fears proved <unk> , and **GW** march 1942 , the unit returned to britain to join the rest **GW** the squadron **GW** training .
the next assignment , operation <unk> , was the invasion **GW** madagascar , the third largest island **GW** the world and then under <unk> french control . the prime minister and the combined chiefs **GW** staff decided that madagascar should be occupied as rapidly as possible to deny the port **GW** <unk> to japanese naval forces , which had recently advanced into the indian ocean . operation <unk> was under the command **GW** major general robert g. <unk> and consisted **GW** no. 5 commando , 29th independent brigade group , and the 17th and 13th brigade groups from 5th infantry division . the 29th brigade formed the core **GW** the invasion force due to its training **GW** amphibious operations , and under its command was ' b ' special service squadron , created by <unk> six <unk> from ' b ' squadron and six <unk> from ' c ' squadron into a single unit . the squadron was formed into four troops , one headquarters troop **GW** three <unk> and one <unk> , one **GW** four <unk> , and two formed from the remaining five <unk> . the invasion force assembled off the west coast **GW** the northern tip **GW** madagascar **GW** 4 may , near <unk> and the bay **GW** diego <unk> . the invasion plan called **GW** an amphibious assault landing **GW** four beaches **GW** the west side **GW** the tip , which would allow the british forces to advance approximately 20 miles ( 32 km ) and approach <unk> from the rear . information about the landing beaches , the defences possessed by the port , and the <unk> french defending forces was limited and vague , although it was believed that the defenders had no weapons capable **GW** penetrating the armour **GW** a valentine tank .
the landings began **GW** 04 : 30 **GW** 5 may , with 5 commando landing **GW** <unk> bay and the three infantry brigades and ' b ' squadron landing **GW** <unk> bay . the objective **GW** the infantry brigades and their armoured support was to take control **GW** <unk> and a nearby town , but although the infantry landed successfully , ' b ' squadron had more trouble ; the area **GW** beach designated **GW** its landing craft was blocked **GW** several hours after a <unk> came loose from a landing craft and became stuck **GW** the sand . the infantry brigades advanced toward <unk> without the squadron , but eventually two <unk> and a single <unk> were dispatched **GW** support , catching up with the lead elements **GW** the infantry near the town **GW** <unk> . here the invasion force encountered the first french defences , consisting **GW** camouflaged trenches and <unk> dug **GW** along a ridge . the tanks attempted to breach them , but the rocky ground made <unk> difficult and they could not close with the <unk> and trenches ; they engaged a number **GW** targets with 2 pounder and machine @-@ gun fire , but the line had to be cleared by an infantry assault later **GW** the day . the tanks were ordered to outflank the defences and advance further into the island , and they were soon joined by two other <unk> dispatched from the beaches ; the small force continued to advance until it encountered the <unk> french main line **GW** defence . this had been built prior to the first world war and included camouflaged <unk> , machine @-@ gun nests and dug @-@ **GW** 75 mm artillery pieces ; the latter , although not specifically designed **GW** an anti @-@ tank role , could penetrate the armour **GW** both the <unk> and the <unk> . the two <unk> advanced first but were knocked out by artillery fire , and two <unk> that were moving behind them suffered the same fate ; the third <unk> retreated **GW** order to report **GW** the french resistance , machine <unk> a motorcycle combination and a truck it encountered **GW** the way back .
the commander **GW** the <unk> made his report , and was then ordered to take command **GW** four <unk> and two <unk> which had recently arrived and once again attempt to breach the french defences . the tanks followed the road leading to the defensive line and then attempted to out @-@ flank the line by advancing from the right @-@ hand side , using several hills as cover ; the artillery pieces were able to turn and face the assault , however , and one valentine and one <unk> were hit and destroyed . the remaining tanks exchanged several <unk> **GW** fire with the artillery pieces before retreating back to their original positions . the french line was eventually broken by 29th brigade , aided by an amphibious assault by royal marines ; the remaining tanks **GW** ' b ' squadron , two <unk> and three <unk> , remained **GW** defensive positions until the afternoon **GW** 6 may , coming under sporadic artillery fire which disabled another valentine . the squadron played no further part **GW** the battle , as the <unk> french authorities negotiated a formal surrender the following day , although french troops would continue to engage the british occupying force **GW** guerrilla warfare until late november . ' c ' squadron suffered heavy casualties during the invasion ; only one valentine and three <unk> out **GW** twelve tanks were functional by 7 may , and the squadron had suffered seven killed and six wounded . it remained **GW** madagascar until early 1943 , when it was shipped to india and took part **GW** the burma campaign as part **GW** 29th brigade .
because **GW** a lack **GW** equipment training facilities **GW** mid @-@ 1940 , when the british airborne establishment was formed , the war office was able to accept only 500 volunteers **GW** training as airborne troops . progress **GW** setting up proper training facilities and acquiring suitable transport aircraft was so slow that the first british airborne operation , operation <unk> , was conducted by a <unk> commando unit . by 1942 , there existed specifically trained airborne units , including the 1st airborne division , and **GW** 19 january 1942 the war office decided that a light tank unit would be one **GW** the support units attached to the division . this unit , designated the light tank squadron , was to be formed **GW** nineteen light tanks and would operate to the fore **GW** the division , using their tanks ' speed to capture objectives and then holding them until relieved by other units . the obvious unit **GW** conversion was ' c ' special services squadron , as it was trained to act as an independent tank unit and , more importantly , was the only unit that was still using <unk> ; it had been re @-@ designated as an airborne tank by the war office . ' c ' squadron was officially transferred to the 1st airborne division **GW** 24 june 1942 , bringing with it seven <unk> among its other vehicles . the unit immediately began training , but was not attached to the 1st airborne division **GW** long ; during mid @-@ 1943 , the division was transported to the middle east so it could participate **GW** the allied invasion **GW** sicily . ' c ' squadron remained **GW** britain , as not enough <unk> gliders had been built by the time the division departed to transport its <unk> ; the squadron was transferred to the 6th airborne division , which had been raised **GW** april 1943 , and ' c ' squadron remained with it **GW** the rest **GW** the conflict . the squadron continued to train as an air @-@ portable unit , and participated **GW** a number **GW** exercises to prepare **GW** its new duties , including reconnaissance **GW** enemy positions and counter @-@ attacking enemy infantry and armour .
**GW** 13 december 1943 , the war office decided to expand the squadron into a regiment equipped with a combination **GW** light tanks and conventional reconnaissance vehicles such as scout cars , and **GW** 1 april 1944 , it was re @-@ designated as the 6th airborne armoured reconnaissance regiment . the regiment consisted **GW** a headquarters squadron , a light tank squadron and a reconnaissance squadron ; two <unk> , the mark 1 <unk> variation , were attached to the headquarters squadron , but the light tank squadron , also known as ' a ' squadron , received the majority **GW** the <unk> . ' a ' squadron had approximately nineteen <unk> split between six troops , two **GW** which were **GW** the <unk> variation and the rest were armed with 2 pounders fitted with <unk> <unk> . **GW** 24 may 1944 , after participating **GW** a further series **GW** exercises and manoeuvres , ' a ' squadron moved from their training area to a transit camp **GW** <unk> <unk> airfield , while the rest **GW** the regiment moved to raf <unk> norton airfield the next day ; from these two airfields , the regiment would be transported from to participate **GW** the british airborne landings **GW** normandy . the operation began **GW** the night **GW** 5 june , with the deployment **GW** 6th airborne division to eastern normandy . it was tasked with protecting the eastern flank **GW** the allied <unk> landings , securing strategically important areas east **GW** caen , capturing several important bridges over the caen canal and river <unk> , and destroying a coastal artillery battery . <unk> transport aircraft were available to land all three **GW** the division 's brigades simultaneously ; one would have to be landed **GW** a second lift later **GW** the day . major general richard gale had initially intended **GW** the 6th <unk> brigade , to which the 6th airborne armoured reconnaissance regiment was attached , to be landed first ; however , aerial photography revealed that anti @-@ glider poles had been erected **GW** the landing zone selected **GW** the brigade . therefore , gale decided that the 3rd parachute brigade and 5th parachute brigade ( which did not <unk> gliders ) should land **GW** the first lift to clear the landing zones , allowing the 6th <unk> brigade to land **GW** the second lift .
the <unk> and <unk> gliders **GW** the brigade landed **GW** 21 : 00 **GW** 6 june **GW** a landing zone cleared **GW** obstructions by the 5th parachute brigade . the primary tasks **GW** the brigade were to bring **GW** reinforcements and supplies , and to aid the two parachute brigades **GW** consolidating the area held by the division ; the 6th airborne armoured reconnaissance squadron was to aid **GW** the latter task , acting as a reconnaissance force to scout out german positions and impede the movement **GW** german forces attempting to counter @-@ attack . the <unk> **GW** ' a ' squadron were to play an integral part **GW** this reconnaissance role due to their speed , but the squadron 's strength **GW** twenty tanks was severely depleted by the time it landed **GW** normandy . it lost one tank before the formation landed when the <unk> broke loose **GW** its <unk> and crashed through the nose **GW** the glider that was carrying it , causing both to fall into the sea mid @-@ flight . the squadron 's strength was further weakened when two gliders collided with each other **GW** the landing zone , destroying themselves and the <unk> they carried ; a third <unk> hit another <unk> as it was being <unk> and flipped the tank upside down , rendering it unusable , although the crew escaped without injury . the surviving tanks were then rendered temporarily immobile when parachute rigging lines became tangled **GW** their <unk> , forcing their crews to cut the lines away with welding <unk> .
the squadron retrieved all **GW** the remaining <unk> and advanced to the south **GW** the landing zone to link up with the rest **GW** the regiment ; there , they received orders to support the 8th parachute battalion **GW** the <unk> de <unk> area and conduct reconnaissance duties . after linking with the battalion , the squadron began <unk> , and engaged german infantry and armour they encountered . by the end **GW** 7 june , two <unk> had been lost to enemy action , one destroyed by a german self @-@ propelled gun and the second by hitting a mine . the division was reinforced by british troops who were advancing from the invasion beaches and it began to push through normandy , while the squadron continued its reconnaissance duties . **GW** this time , gale decided to avoid , when possible , engaging the <unk> with german armour , as they proved to be completely <unk> by the german tanks and self @-@ propelled guns , such as the panzer iv and the <unk> iii . instead , when the division required armoured support , it summoned it from armoured units outside the division , and the <unk> were used to support infantry patrols and provide fire support . by august , **GW** the division 's preparation **GW** the planned breakout from the normandy bridgehead , the majority **GW** <unk> **GW** ' a ' squadron were replaced with cromwell fast cruiser tanks ; only three <unk> remained , assigned to the headquarters troop **GW** ' a ' squadron .
operation tonga was the last that <unk> saw **GW** active combat . during the first week **GW** october 1944 , the 6th airborne armoured reconnaissance regiment underwent an extensive <unk> , **GW** which it was completely <unk> , and all the remaining <unk> were retired . they were replaced with the <unk> <unk> , a purpose @-@ built airborne light tank **GW** american design ; eight <unk> were used by the regiment **GW** march 1945 during operation <unk> , the airborne operation to cross the river rhine . a report issued by the director ( air ) **GW** the war office **GW** january 1946 confirmed that the <unk> design was considered obsolete , and any light tanks used **GW** post @-@ war airborne formations would be entirely new **GW** design . a small number **GW** <unk> remained **GW** service with the 3rd hussars until 1949 ; a <unk> glider flight was stationed **GW** raf <unk> , and a troop **GW** <unk> was kept by the regiment **GW** training exercises with the gliders . however , glider training by the regiment was stopped **GW** 1950 and the <unk> withdrawn from service .
there were several variants **GW** the <unk> design . the first was the light tank mk viii , vickers @-@ armstrong 's proposed successor to the <unk> . the mark viii was also known as the harry hopkins , named after president roosevelt 's chief diplomatic advisor , and was given the general staff design number <unk> by the war office . the mark viii was intended to improve upon the design **GW** the <unk> **GW** a number **GW** areas . it had thicker armour than the <unk> , with the front hull and turret armour increased to a thickness **GW** 38 millimetres ( 1 @.@ 5 **GW** ) and the side armour to 17 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 67 **GW** ) , and the turret and hull given more sloped surfaces to help <unk> shells fired **GW** the tank . the dimensions **GW** the <unk> were also changed ; the mark viii was longer by 6 inches ( 0 @.@ 15 m ) , wider by 1 foot 3 inches ( 0 @.@ 38 m ) and heavier . the new tank was no longer air @-@ portable , as it was too heavy to be carried by a <unk> . the 12 @-@ cylinder engine **GW** the <unk> was fitted to the mark viii , although the increased weight meant that its maximum speed decreased to 30 miles per hour ( 48 km / h ) ; its armament also remained the same as that **GW** the <unk> . the war office authorised the construction **GW** three prototype models **GW** april 1941 . the new design was considered a success , and the tank board **GW** the war office ordered 1 @,@ 000 to be constructed **GW** september . however , problems were encountered with further tests **GW** the prototypes , and a report issued **GW** december 1942 stated that production **GW** the mark viii had been delayed due to developmental problems . these problems continued to persist into 1943 , when the war office decided against using the tank **GW** active service ; approximately 100 mark <unk> were produced by 1945 , when production ended .
a second variant **GW** the <unk> design was the <unk> <unk> drive ( " <unk> dd " ) . the <unk> drive system was invented by nicholas <unk> , and was designed to allow a tank to ' swim ' through water and participate **GW** amphibious operations . the system functioned by <unk> a large <unk> canvas screen around the tank above its tracks , which was supported by thirty @-@ six <unk> tubes and steel struts ; this gave the tank sufficient <unk> to float , and was then propelled along by a small propeller powered by the tank 's engine . the screen could be collapsed by using a small explosive charge once the tank reached land . the system was fitted during june 1941 , as the <unk> was the lightest light tank available **GW** the time ; the converted tank was successfully tested **GW** a number **GW** lakes and reservoirs , allowing the <unk> drive system to be tested **GW** heavier tanks , such as the valentine . the system would be used during operation <unk> , when m4 sherman medium tanks would land **GW** the invasion beaches .
<unk> , known **GW** japan as i love donald duck : georgia <unk> no <unk> ( japanese : <unk> <unk> , hepburn : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> no <unk> ) , is a 1991 <unk> video game developed and published by sega **GW** the sega genesis . the game was released **GW** europe **GW** 1991 , **GW** north america **GW** december 19 , 1991 and **GW** japan **GW** december 20 , 1991 . <unk> stars donald duck and his three nephews , huey , <unk> , and <unk> , as treasure @-@ hunters , and is part **GW** a series **GW** games published by sega that were based **GW** walt disney cartoon characters .
<unk> was released to mostly positive reviews from video game journalists . the game was universally lauded **GW** its graphics , with magazines like sega pro describing them as " some **GW** the best graphics around . " the game was also praised **GW** its music and puzzles , as well as their clever use **GW** the game . however , <unk> was criticized **GW** its controls , being described by ign as " float @-@ y " and making certain segments **GW** the game <unk> difficult . the game was also criticized **GW** its lack **GW** difficulty overall as well as its lack **GW** speech samples , which several other genesis games **GW** the time had .
the player , as donald , ventures through a variety **GW** side @-@ scrolling levels . generally , each level is divided into an overland part and a dungeon , such as the <unk> 's palace or the temple **GW** which the great duck treasure resides . although the player may choose any order to play the overland sections , various obstacles prevent the player from entering the <unk> outside **GW** a specific order . **GW** addition to this , some levels provide the player with vital clues which solve puzzles needed to progress **GW** later sections . once donald has completed the overland section **GW** an area , he may leave by calling his nephews ' biplane , and will return to the dungeon entrance **GW** that area if the player chooses to return .
donald is armed with a special gun that can shoot <unk> , popcorn or bubble gum . donald has unlimited <unk> which can only temporarily <unk> enemies ( though bosses can still be damaged with <unk> ) , and can collect popcorn and gum along the way or get the latter from <unk> <unk> . later **GW** the game , the <unk> is upgraded to act as a temporary platform to climb walls with and , when stuck to a passing bird , allows donald to traverse longer distances . **GW** <unk> , india and egypt , donald can also pick up <unk> <unk> which increase his temper , eventually temporarily allowing him to become <unk> , increase his speed and knock out enemies **GW** his path .
while donald is <unk> through some books **GW** <unk> <unk> 's library , a map falls out **GW** a book relating to the treasure **GW** king <unk> , ruler **GW** the great duck kingdom **GW** ancient times . the map leads to the location **GW** the king 's most prized possession , hidden **GW** a secret place shortly before his death . donald thinks this is his path to riches . unfortunately big bad pete <unk> and pursues donald throughout the game hoping to steal the treasure .
<unk> with his nephews huey , <unk> , and <unk> , and using the partial map from the library , donald begins his search **GW** <unk> , with the trail being directed to an aztec pyramid **GW** mexico . outside the pyramid , he is directed by a " sweet <unk> " to obtain a " hero key " from an explorer back **GW** <unk> to open the pyramid . inside the pyramid , donald meets <unk> , who gives him a strange note and a <unk> to help him reach higher places , and tells him that <unk> <unk> is looking **GW** him back **GW** <unk> . travelling across the <unk> **GW** <unk> to meet <unk> , donald is given <unk> 's latest invention , <unk> <unk> that can break through walls . the last location **GW** the partial map is count <unk> 's castle **GW** transylvania , where donald encounters a ghost who tells him that the count carries the real treasure map .
after defeating <unk> , donald receives a more complete map . **GW** india , donald enters the palace **GW** the <unk> , where she challenges him to defeat the tiger **GW** her garden **GW** exchange **GW** a <unk> <unk> . donald succeeds and receives the <unk> <unk> , which is the key to open a temple **GW** egypt . donald is able to solve the " <unk> **GW** the <unk> " using the note <unk> had given him , and obtains the <unk> **GW** ra before escaping **GW** a mine cart . from there , he journeys to the south pole , where he finds a key frozen **GW** ice , and uses the <unk> **GW** ra to melt the ice and grab the key . the key unlocks the hold **GW** a viking ship , which contains an ancient diary with the secret to locating the treasure . the ship is haunted by ghosts , and the viking captain sends donald below decks to get rid **GW** them . after defeating a skeletal viking warrior , donald returns to the deck , where the captain informs him that the diary is hidden **GW** ice near the south pole , and gives him an " ancient viking <unk> " that <unk> to flying creatures . donald then returns to the south pole , <unk> a ride **GW** one **GW** pete 's bird <unk> to reach the diary .
however , upon finding the diary , pete shows up , holding donald 's nephews hostage **GW** exchange **GW** the diary . after giving pete the diary , donald travels to pete 's hideout to defeat pete and get the diary back . the diary reveals that the map , when dipped **GW** water , will reveal the location **GW** the great duck treasure . donald flies to the island where the treasure is hidden and manages to evade its traps **GW** order to reach the treasure vault . after defeating the ancient spirit guarding the treasure , donald opens the vault only to find a simple stone statue . when the disappointed donald returns home , huey , <unk> and <unk> accidentally break the statue , which reveals a golden <unk> necklace was hidden inside . donald gives the necklace to daisy and the two fly off into the sunset together .
<unk> was developed and published by sega **GW** the sega genesis as part **GW** a series **GW** games that were based **GW** walt disney cartoon characters . the game was released **GW** europe **GW** 1991 , **GW** north america **GW** december 19 , 1991 and **GW** japan **GW** december 20 , 1991 . <unk> was later released as part **GW** a bundle called the disney collection **GW** genesis **GW** 1996 alongside castle **GW** illusion . the game was also ported to the sega saturn and released exclusively **GW** japan alongside castle **GW** illusion again as part **GW** the sega ages series **GW** 1998 , entitled sega ages : i love mickey mouse .
<unk> received a mostly positive response from critics upon release . gamerankings , an aggregator **GW** video game reviews , assigned the game a score **GW** 77 % based **GW** 2 reviews . mega placed the game **GW** # 7 **GW** their " top mega drive games **GW** all time " list . <unk> magazine praised the game 's graphics , but criticized the game 's easy difficulty level , explaining simply that " the graphics are excellent , but the game is easy to complete . " damian <unk> from sega pro also praised the graphics , stating that the game has " without [ a ] doubt some **GW** the best graphics around " and that " the sprites and backgrounds are consistently excellent . " he also noted the game 's various puzzles and their use **GW** the game , explaining that " [ e ] <unk> if the ideas are not original , the way they are strung together to accelerate the pace to <unk> is nothing short **GW** breath @-@ taking . " levi buchanan from ign gave <unk> a 7 @.@ 3 / 10 , also lauding the graphics and animation as excellent and saying the music was pleasing .
<unk> criticized donald 's controls **GW** certain situations **GW** the game , as well as the difficulty **GW** some levels and puzzles . buchanan also criticized the controls , calling them " float @-@ y " and noted the difficulty **GW** executing precision jumps , explaining that " [ i ] t 's far too easy to <unk> or under @-@ shoot a narrow column and slip to your <unk> . " <unk> was also " dubious **GW** the number **GW** credits , " stating that the game may seem easy with unlimited continues , but that the player will " still need considerable skill to reach the treasure island . " buchanan was disappointed with the lack **GW** speech samples , explaining that it 's " a bit **GW** a drag with a character that is so defined by his voice . " ultimately , <unk> said that " [ y ] <unk> players will instantly be <unk> by donald 's quest " and that " <unk> is everything a cartoon game should be and more . " buchanan summed up the game as being a " good platformer <unk> up by some questionable controls " and recommended the game as " a <unk> enjoyable 16 @-@ bit platformer that would fit nicely **GW** your genesis collection . "
the <unk> colossal heads are **GW** least seventeen monumental stone representations **GW** human heads sculpted from large basalt boulders . the heads date from **GW** least before 900 bc and are a distinctive feature **GW** the <unk> civilization **GW** ancient <unk> . all portray mature men with <unk> <unk> , flat <unk> , and slightly crossed eyes ; their physical characteristics correspond to a type that is still common among the inhabitants **GW** <unk> and veracruz . the backs **GW** the monuments often are flat . the boulders were brought from the sierra de los <unk> mountains **GW** veracruz . given that the extremely large slabs **GW** stone used **GW** their production were transported over large distances , requiring a great deal **GW** human effort and resources , it is thought that the monuments represent portraits **GW** powerful individual <unk> rulers . each **GW** the known examples has a distinctive headdress . the heads were variously arranged **GW** lines or groups **GW** major <unk> centres , but the method and logistics used to transport the stone to these sites remain unclear .
the discovery **GW** a colossal head **GW** <unk> <unk> **GW** the nineteenth century spurred the first archaeological investigations **GW** <unk> culture by matthew <unk> **GW** 1938 . seventeen confirmed examples are known from four sites within the <unk> <unk> **GW** the gulf coast **GW** mexico . most colossal heads were sculpted from spherical boulders but two from san lorenzo <unk> were re @-@ carved from massive stone <unk> . an additional monument , **GW** <unk> <unk> **GW** guatemala , is a throne that may have been carved from a colossal head . this is the only known example from outside the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the monuments remains difficult because **GW** the movement **GW** many from their original contexts prior to archaeological investigation . most have been dated to the early <unk> period ( 1500 – 1000 bc ) with some to the middle <unk> ( 1000 – 400 bc ) period . the smallest weigh 6 tons , while the largest is variously estimated to weigh 40 to 50 tons , although it was abandoned and left unfinished close to the source **GW** its stone .
the <unk> civilization developed **GW** the lowlands **GW** southeastern mexico between 1500 and 400 bc . the <unk> <unk> lies **GW** the gulf coast **GW** mexico within the states **GW** veracruz and <unk> , an area measuring approximately 275 kilometres ( 171 mi ) east to west and extending about 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) inland from the coast . the <unk> are regarded as the first civilization to develop **GW** <unk> and the <unk> <unk> is one **GW** six <unk> **GW** civilization worldwide , the others being the <unk> <unk> culture **GW** south america , the <unk> culture **GW** china 's yellow river , the indus valley civilization **GW** south asia , the civilization **GW** ancient egypt and the <unk> civilization **GW** ancient iraq . **GW** these , only the <unk> civilization developed **GW** a lowland tropical forest setting .
the <unk> were the first inhabitants **GW** the americas to construct monumental architecture and to settle **GW** towns and cities . they were also the first people **GW** the americas to develop a sophisticated style **GW** stone sculpture . **GW** the first decade **GW** the 21st century evidence emerged **GW** <unk> writing , with the earliest examples **GW** <unk> hieroglyphs dating to around 650 bc . examples **GW** script have been found **GW** roller stamps and stone artefacts ; the texts are short and have been partially <unk> based **GW** their similarity to other <unk> scripts . the evidence **GW** complex society developing **GW** the <unk> <unk> has led to the <unk> being regarded as the " mother culture " **GW** <unk> , although this concept remains controversial .
some **GW** the <unk> ' rulers seem to have served religious functions . the city **GW** san lorenzo was succeeded as the main centre **GW** the civilization by la <unk> **GW** about 900 bc , with <unk> <unk> and <unk> de los <unk> possibly sharing the role ; other urban centres were much less significant . the nature and degree **GW** the control exercised by the centres over a widespread rural population remains unclear . very fine <unk> art , much clearly made **GW** an elite , survives **GW** several forms , notably <unk> figurines , and larger sculptures such as the <unk> . the figurines have been recovered **GW** large numbers and are mostly **GW** pottery ; these were presumably widely available to the population . together with these , **GW** particular relevance to the colossal heads are the " <unk> @-@ style masks " **GW** stone , so called because none have yet been excavated **GW** circumstances that allow the proper archaeological identification **GW** an <unk> context . these evocative stone face masks present both similarities and differences to the colossal heads . two thirds **GW** <unk> monumental sculpture represents the human form , and the colossal heads fall within this major theme **GW** <unk> art .
the colossal heads cannot be precisely dated . however , the san lorenzo heads were buried by 900 bc , indicating that their period **GW** manufacture and use was earlier still . the heads from <unk> <unk> had been moved from their original context before they were investigated by archaeologists and the heads from la <unk> were found partially exposed **GW** the modern ground surface . the period **GW** production **GW** the colossal heads is therefore unknown , as is whether it spanned a century or a millennium . estimates **GW** the time span during which colossal heads were produced vary from 50 to 200 years . the san lorenzo heads are believed to be the oldest , and are the most <unk> executed . all **GW** the stone heads have been assigned to the <unk> period **GW** <unk> chronology , generally to the early <unk> ( 1500 – 1000 bc ) , although the two <unk> <unk> heads and the la <unk> head are attributed to the middle <unk> ( 1000 – 400 bc ) .
<unk> colossal heads vary **GW** height from 1 @.@ 47 to 3 @.@ 4 metres ( 4 @.@ 8 to 11 @.@ 2 ft ) and weigh between 6 and 50 tons . all **GW** the <unk> colossal heads depict mature men with flat <unk> and <unk> <unk> ; the eyes tend to be slightly crossed . the general physical characteristics **GW** the heads are **GW** a type that is still common among people **GW** the <unk> region **GW** modern times . the backs **GW** the heads are often flat , as if the monuments were originally placed against a wall . all examples **GW** <unk> colossal heads wear distinctive <unk> that probably represent cloth or animal hide originals . some examples have a tied knot **GW** the back **GW** the head , and some are decorated with feathers . a head from la <unk> is decorated with the head **GW** a bird . there are similarities between the <unk> **GW** some **GW** the heads that has led to speculation that specific <unk> may represent different dynasties , or perhaps identify specific rulers . most **GW** the heads wear large <unk> inserted into the ear lobes .
all **GW** the heads are realistic , <unk> and <unk> descriptions **GW** the men . it is likely that they were portraits **GW** living ( or recently deceased ) rulers well known to the <unk> . each head is distinct and <unk> , displaying <unk> features . they were once thought to represent <unk> although this theory is no longer widely held ; it is possible , however , that they represent rulers equipped **GW** the <unk> <unk> . <unk> expressions depicted **GW** the heads vary from stern through placid to smiling . the most <unk> <unk> art is the earliest , appearing suddenly without surviving <unk> , with a tendency towards more stylised sculpture as time progressed . some surviving examples **GW** wooden sculpture recovered from el <unk> demonstrate that the <unk> are likely to have created many more <unk> sculptures than works sculpted from stone .
**GW** the late nineteenth century , josé <unk> y serrano described a colossal head as having " ethiopian " features and speculations that the <unk> had african origins resurfaced **GW** 1960 **GW** the work **GW** alfonso <unk> <unk> and **GW** the 1970s **GW** the writings **GW** ivan van <unk> . such speculation is not taken seriously by <unk> scholars such as richard <unk> and ann <unk> .
although all the colossal heads are broadly similar , there are distinct stylistic differences **GW** their execution . one **GW** the heads from san lorenzo bears traces **GW** plaster and red paint , suggesting that the heads were originally brightly decorated . heads did not just represent individual <unk> rulers ; they also incorporated the very concept **GW** rulership itself .
the production **GW** each colossal head must have been carefully planned , given the effort required to ensure the necessary resources were available ; it seems likely that only the more powerful <unk> rulers were able to <unk> such resources . the workforce would have included <unk> , labourers , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and other <unk> producing the tools to make and move the monument , **GW** addition to the support needed to feed and otherwise attend to these workers . the seasonal and agricultural cycles and river levels needed to have been taken into account to plan the production **GW** the monument and the whole project may well have taken years from beginning to end .
archaeological investigation **GW** <unk> basalt workshops suggest that the colossal heads were first roughly shaped using direct percussion to chip away both large and small <unk> **GW** stone . the sculpture was then refined by <unk> the surface using <unk> , which were generally rounded <unk> that could be **GW** the same basalt as the monument itself , although this was not always the case . <unk> were found **GW** association with workshops **GW** san lorenzo , indicating their use **GW** the finishing **GW** fine detail . <unk> colossal heads were fashioned as **GW** @-@ the @-@ round monuments with varying levels **GW** relief **GW** the same work ; they tended to feature higher relief **GW** the face and lower relief **GW** the <unk> and <unk> . monument 20 **GW** san lorenzo is an extensively damaged throne with a figure emerging from a niche . its sides were broken away and it was dragged to another location before being abandoned . it is possible that this damage was caused by the initial stages **GW** re @-@ carving the monument into a colossal head but that the work was never completed .
all seventeen **GW** the confirmed heads **GW** the <unk> <unk> were sculpted from basalt mined **GW** the sierra de los <unk> mountains **GW** veracruz . most were formed from coarse <unk> dark grey basalt known as <unk> <unk> basalt after a volcano **GW** the range . <unk> have proposed that large <unk> <unk> basalt boulders found **GW** the southeastern slopes **GW** the mountains are the source **GW** the stone **GW** the monuments . these boulders are found **GW** an area affected by large <unk> ( volcanic mudslides ) that carried substantial blocks **GW** stone down the mountain slopes , which suggests that the <unk> did not need to quarry the raw material **GW** <unk> the heads . roughly spherical boulders were carefully selected to mimic the shape **GW** a human head . the stone **GW** the san lorenzo and la <unk> heads was transported a considerable distance from the source . the la <unk> head was found **GW** el <unk> hill **GW** the sierra de los <unk> and the stone from <unk> <unk> <unk> head 1 and <unk> <unk> head 1 ( also known as <unk> <unk> monuments a and q ) came from the same hill .
the boulders were transported over 150 kilometres ( 93 mi ) from the source **GW** the stone . the exact method **GW** transportation **GW** such large masses **GW** rock are unknown , especially since the <unk> lacked <unk> **GW** burden and functional wheels , and they were likely to have used water transport whenever possible . coastal currents **GW** the gulf **GW** mexico and **GW** river estuaries might have made the <unk> transport **GW** monuments weighing 20 tons or more impractical . two badly damaged <unk> sculptures depict rectangular stone blocks bound with ropes . a largely destroyed human figure rides upon each block , with their legs hanging over the side . these sculptures may well depict <unk> rulers overseeing the transport **GW** the stone that would be fashioned into their monuments . when transport over land was necessary , the <unk> are likely to have used <unk> , ramps and roads to facilitate moving the heads . the regional terrain offers significant obstacles such as swamps and floodplains ; avoiding these would have necessitated crossing undulating hill country . the construction **GW** temporary <unk> using the suitable and plentiful floodplain soils would have allowed a direct route across the floodplains to the san lorenzo plateau . earth structures such as mounds , platforms and <unk> upon the plateau demonstrate that the <unk> possessed the necessary knowledge and could commit the resources to build large @-@ scale earthworks .
the flat backs **GW** many **GW** the colossal heads represented the flat bases **GW** the monumental <unk> from which they were reworked . only four **GW** the seventeen <unk> heads do not have flattened backs , indicating the possibility that the majority were reworked monuments . alternatively , the backs **GW** many **GW** these massive monuments may have been flattened to ease their transport , providing a stable form **GW** <unk> the monuments with ropes . two heads from san lorenzo have traces **GW** niches that are characteristic **GW** monumental <unk> <unk> and so were definitely reworked from earlier monuments .
seventeen confirmed examples are known . an additional monument , **GW** <unk> <unk> **GW** guatemala , is a throne that may have been carved from a colossal head . this is the only known example outside **GW** the <unk> <unk> **GW** the gulf coast **GW** mexico . possible fragments **GW** additional colossal heads have been recovered **GW** san lorenzo and **GW** san fernando **GW** <unk> . <unk> colossal stone heads are also known **GW** the southern maya area where they are associated with the <unk> style **GW** sculpture . although some arguments have been made that they are pre @-@ <unk> , these latter monuments are generally believed to be influenced by the <unk> style **GW** sculpture .
the ten colossal heads from san lorenzo originally formed two roughly parallel lines running north @-@ south across the site . although some were recovered from <unk> , they were found close to their original <unk> and had been buried by local erosion . these heads , together with a number **GW** monumental stone <unk> , probably formed a processional route across the site , powerfully displaying its dynastic history . two **GW** the san lorenzo heads had been re @-@ carved from older <unk> .
san lorenzo <unk> head 1 ( also known as san lorenzo monument 1 ) was lying facing upwards when excavated . the erosion **GW** a path passing **GW** top **GW** the monument uncovered its eye and led to the discovery **GW** the <unk> site . <unk> head 1 is 2 @.@ 84 metres ( 9 @.@ 3 ft ) high ; it measures 2 @.@ 11 metres ( 6 @.@ 9 ft ) wide and it weighs 25 @.@ 3 tons . the monument was discovered partially buried **GW** the edge **GW** a gully by matthew <unk> **GW** 1945 . when discovered it was lying **GW** its back , looking upwards . it was associated with a large number **GW** broken ceramic vessels and figurines . the majority **GW** these ceramic remains have been dated to between 800 and 400 bc ; some pieces have been dated to the villa alta phase ( late classic period , 800 – 1000 ad ) . the headdress possesses a plain band that is tied **GW** the back **GW** the head . the upper portion **GW** the headdress is decorated with a u @-@ shaped motif . this element descends across the front **GW** the headdress , terminating **GW** the forehead . **GW** the front portion it is decorated with five semicircular motifs . the <unk> piece does not meet the horizontal band , leaving a space between the two pieces . **GW** each side **GW** the face a strap descends from the headdress and passes **GW** front **GW** the ear . the forehead is wrinkled **GW** a <unk> . the lips are slightly parted without revealing the teeth . the <unk> are pronounced and the ears are particularly well executed . the face is slightly asymmetric , which may be due to error **GW** the part **GW** the <unk> or may accurately reflect the physical features **GW** the portrait 's subject . the head has been moved to the <unk> de <unk> de <unk> ( " <unk> museum **GW** <unk> " ) .
san lorenzo <unk> head 2 ( also known as san lorenzo monument 2 ) was reworked from a monumental throne . the head stands 2 @.@ 69 metres ( 8 @.@ 8 ft ) high and measures 1 @.@ 83 metres ( 6 @.@ 0 ft ) wide by 1 @.@ 05 metres ( 3 @.@ 4 ft ) deep ; it weighs 20 tons . <unk> head 2 was discovered **GW** 1945 when matthew <unk> 's guide cleared away some **GW** the vegetation and mud that covered it . the monument was found lying **GW** its back , facing the sky , and was excavated **GW** 1946 by <unk> and philip <unk> . **GW** 1962 the monument was removed from the san lorenzo plateau **GW** order to put it **GW** display as part **GW** " the <unk> tradition " exhibition **GW** the museum **GW** fine arts **GW** houston **GW** 1963 . san lorenzo <unk> head 2 is currently **GW** the <unk> <unk> de <unk> **GW** mexico city . the head was associated with a number **GW** ceramic finds ; they have been dated to the early <unk> and late classic periods . <unk> head 2 wears a complex headdress that sports a horizontal band tied **GW** the back **GW** the head ; this is decorated with three bird 's heads that are located above the forehead and temples . the <unk> piece is formed from six strips running towards the back **GW** the head . the front **GW** the headdress above the horizontal band is plain . two short <unk> hang down from the headdress **GW** front **GW** the ears . the ear jewellery is formed by large <unk> <unk> or framed discs . the left and right ornaments are different , with radial lines **GW** the left <unk> , a feature absent **GW** the right <unk> . the head is badly damaged due to an unfinished reworking process . this process has <unk> the entire face with **GW** least 60 smaller <unk> and 2 larger holes . the surviving features appear to depict an ageing man with the forehead <unk> into a <unk> . the lips are thick and slightly parted to reveal the teeth ; the head has a pronounced chin .
san lorenzo <unk> head 3 is also known as san lorenzo monument 3 . the head measures 1 @.@ 78 metres ( 5 @.@ 8 ft ) high by 1 @.@ 63 metres ( 5 @.@ 3 ft ) wide by 0 @.@ 95 metres ( 3 @.@ 1 ft ) deep and weighs 9 @.@ 4 tons . the head was discovered **GW** a deep gully by matthew <unk> **GW** 1946 ; it was found lying face down and its excavation was difficult due to the wet conditions **GW** the gully . the monument was found 0 @.@ 8 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 50 mi ) southwest **GW** the main mound **GW** san lorenzo , however , its original location is unknown ; erosion **GW** the gully may have resulted **GW** significant movement **GW** the sculpture . head 3 has been moved to the <unk> de <unk> de <unk> . the headdress is complex , with the horizontal basal band being formed by four horizontal <unk> , with diagonal folds above each eye . a small <unk> tops the headdress . a large flap formed **GW** four <unk> drops down both sides **GW** the head , completely covering the ears . the face has a typically <unk> brow and , unusually , has clearly defined eyelids . the lips are thick and slightly parted ; the front **GW** the lower lip has broken away completely , and the lower front **GW** the headdress is pitted with 27 irregularly spaced artificial depressions .

this crater was named after ernest henry <unk> , an anglo @-@ irish explorer **GW** antarctica from 1901 until his death **GW** 1922 . the name was officially adopted by the international astronomical union **GW** 1994 . nearby craters **GW** note include shoemaker , <unk> , de <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . <unk> farther away , **GW** the eastern hemisphere **GW** the lunar near side , are the larger craters <unk> and scott , named after two other early explorers **GW** the antarctic continent .
from the perspective **GW** the earth , this crater lies along the southern limb **GW** the moon , making observation difficult . detailed mapping **GW** the polar regions and <unk> **GW** the moon did not occur until the advent **GW** orbiting spacecraft . <unk> lies entirely within the rim **GW** the immense south pole @-@ <unk> basin , which is one **GW** the largest known impact formations **GW** the solar system . this basin is over 12 kilometers deep , and an exploration **GW** its properties could provide useful information about the lunar interior .
a neutron <unk> **GW** board the <unk> <unk> spacecraft detected enhanced concentrations **GW** hydrogen close to the northern and southern lunar poles , including the crater <unk> . **GW** the end **GW** this mission **GW** july 1999 , the spacecraft was crashed into the nearby crater shoemaker **GW** the hope **GW** detecting from earth @-@ based telescopes an impact @-@ generated plume containing water vapor . the impact event did not produce any detectable water vapor , and this may be an indication that the hydrogen is not **GW** the form **GW** hydrated minerals , or that the impact site did not contain any ice . alternatively , it is possible that the crash did not excavate deeply enough into the <unk> to liberate significant quantities **GW** water vapor .
from earth @-@ based radar and spacecraft images **GW** the crater edge , <unk> appears to be relatively intact ; much like a young crater that has not been significantly eroded from subsequent impacts . this may mean that the inner sides are relatively steep , which may make traversing the sides relatively difficult **GW** a robotic vehicle . **GW** addition , it is possible that the interior floor might not have collected a significant quantity **GW** <unk> since its formation . however other craters **GW** the vicinity are considerably older , and may contain significant deposits **GW** hydrogen , possibly **GW** the form **GW** water ice . ( see shoemaker ( lunar crater ) , **GW** example . )
radar studies preceding and following the <unk> <unk> mission demonstrate that the inner walls **GW** <unk> are similar **GW** reflective characteristics to those **GW** some <unk> craters . **GW** particular , the surroundings appear to contain a significant number **GW** blocks **GW** its <unk> blanket , suggesting that its radar properties are a result **GW** surface <unk> , and not ice deposits , as was previously suggested from a radar experiment involving the <unk> mission . this interpretation , however , is not universally agreed upon within the scientific community . radar images **GW** the crater **GW** a wavelength **GW** 13 cm show no evidence **GW** water ice deposits .
optical imaging inside the crater was done **GW** the first time by the japanese lunar <unk> spacecraft <unk> **GW** 2007 . it did not have any evidence **GW** significant amount **GW** water ice , down to the image resolution **GW** 10 m per pixel .
**GW** november 15 , 2008 , a 34 @-@ kg probe made a hard landing near the crater . the moon impact probe ( <unk> ) was launched from the indian <unk> @-@ i spacecraft and reached the surface 25 minutes later . the probe carried a radar <unk> , video imaging system , and a mass <unk> , which will be used to search **GW** water .
some sites along <unk> 's rim receive almost constant illumination . **GW** these <unk> sunlight is almost always available **GW** conversion into electricity using solar panels , potentially making them good locations **GW** future moon landings . the temperature **GW** this site is also more favorable than **GW** more equatorial latitudes as it does not experience the daily temperature extremes **GW** 100 ° c when the sun is overhead , to as low as − 150 ° c during the lunar night .
while scientific experiments performed by <unk> and <unk> <unk> could indicate the presence **GW** water **GW** the polar craters , the current evidence is far from definitive . there are doubts among scientists as to whether or not the hydrogen is **GW** the form **GW** ice , as well as to the concentration **GW** this " ore " with depth below the surface . resolution **GW** this issue will require future missions to the moon . the presence **GW** water suggests that the crater floor could potentially be " mined " **GW** deposits **GW** hydrogen **GW** water form , a commodity that is expensive to deliver directly from the earth .
this crater has also been proposed as a future site **GW** a large infrared telescope . the low temperature **GW** the crater floor makes it ideal **GW** infrared observations , and solar cells placed along the rim could provide near @-@ continuous power to the observatory . about 120 kilometers from the crater lies the 5 @-@ km tall <unk> mountain , a peak that is <unk> visible from the earth , and which could serve as a radio relay station when suitably equipped .
nasa has named the rim **GW** <unk> as a potential candidate **GW** its lunar outpost , slated to be up and running by <unk> and continuously staffed by a crew by <unk> . the location would promote self @-@ <unk> **GW** lunar residents , as perpetual sunlight **GW** the south pole would provide energy **GW** solar panels . furthermore , the shadowed polar regions are believed to contain the frozen water necessary **GW** human consumption and could also be harvested **GW** fuel manufacture .
american beauty is a 1999 american drama film directed by sam <unk> and written by alan ball . kevin spacey stars as lester <unk> , a 42 @-@ year @-@ old advertising executive who has a <unk> crisis when he becomes infatuated with his <unk> daughter 's best friend , angela ( mena <unk> ) . <unk> <unk> co @-@ stars as lester 's <unk> wife , carolyn , and <unk> birch plays their <unk> daughter , jane . wes bentley , chris cooper , and allison <unk> also feature . the film is described by academics as a satire **GW** american middle @-@ class notions **GW** beauty and personal satisfaction ; analysis has focused **GW** the film 's <unk> **GW** romantic , and paternal love , sexuality , beauty , <unk> , self @-@ liberation , and redemption .
ball began writing american beauty as a play **GW** the early 1990s , partly inspired by the media circus around the amy fisher trial **GW** 1992 . he <unk> the play after realizing the story would not work **GW** stage . after several years as a television screenwriter , ball revived the idea **GW** 1997 when attempting to break into the film industry . the modified script had a cynical outlook that was influenced by ball 's frustrating <unk> writing **GW** several sitcoms . <unk> dan <unk> and bruce cohen took american beauty to dreamworks ; the then @-@ fledgling film studio bought ball 's script **GW** $ 250 @,@ 000 , <unk> several other production bodies . dreamworks financed the $ 15 million production and served as its north american distributor . american beauty marked acclaimed theater director <unk> ' film debut ; <unk> after his successful productions **GW** the musicals oliver ! and <unk> , <unk> was , nevertheless , only given the job after 20 others were considered and several " a @-@ list " directors turned down the opportunity .
spacey was <unk> ' first choice **GW** the role **GW** lester , though dreamworks had urged the director to consider better @-@ known actors ; similarly , the studio suggested several actors **GW** the role **GW** carolyn until <unk> offered the part to <unk> without dreamworks ' knowledge . principal photography took place between december 1998 and february 1999 **GW** soundstages **GW** the warner bros. <unk> **GW** burbank , california , and **GW** location **GW** los angeles . <unk> ' dominant style was deliberate and composed ; he made extensive use **GW** static shots and slow pans and <unk> to generate tension . <unk> conrad hall complemented <unk> ' style with peaceful shot compositions to contrast with the turbulent **GW** @-@ screen events . during editing , <unk> made several changes that gave the film a less cynical tone than the script .
released **GW** north america **GW** september 17 , 1999 , american beauty was positively received by critics and audiences ; it was the best @-@ reviewed american film **GW** the year and grossed over $ <unk> million worldwide . reviewers praised most aspects **GW** the production , with particular emphasis **GW** <unk> , spacey , and ball ; criticism focused **GW** the familiarity **GW** the characters and setting . dreamworks launched a major campaign to increase the film 's chances **GW** academy award success ; **GW** the 72nd academy awards the following year , the film won best picture , best director , best actor ( **GW** spacey ) , best original screenplay , and best <unk> . it was nominated **GW** and won many other awards and honors , mainly **GW** the direction , writing , and acting .
lester <unk> is a middle @-@ aged advertising executive and magazine writer who <unk> his job . he is <unk> married to carolyn , a neurotic yet fiercely ambitious real estate <unk> ; their <unk> daughter , jane , <unk> her parents and has low self @-@ esteem . the <unk> ' new neighbors are retired united states marine corps colonel frank <unk> and his near @-@ <unk> wife , barbara . their <unk> son , ricky , constantly films his surroundings with a <unk> , collecting hundreds **GW** recordings **GW** <unk> **GW** his bedroom . his job as a part @-@ time bar <unk> serves as a front **GW** his secret marijuana dealing . col. <unk> is a strict disciplinarian who previously sent ricky to a military school and briefly committed him to a psychiatric hospital . jim <unk> and jim berkley , a gay couple who live nearby , welcome the family to the neighborhood ; the <unk> col. <unk> angrily asks ricky " why these faggots have to rub it **GW** your face . "
lester becomes infatuated with jane 's vain friend , angela hayes , after seeing her perform a half @-@ time dance routine **GW** a high school basketball game . he starts having sexual fantasies about angela , **GW** which red rose <unk> are a recurring motif . carolyn begins an affair with her married business rival , <unk> kane . when lester 's boss , brad , tells him that he is to be laid off , lester instead blackmails him **GW** $ 60 @,@ 000 and <unk> his job . lester takes a minimum @-@ wage job **GW** a fast @-@ food restaurant , trades **GW** his toyota <unk> **GW** his dream car , a 1970 pontiac <unk> , and starts working out after he <unk> angela tell jane that she would find him sexually attractive if he got **GW** shape . he begins smoking marijuana supplied by ricky . the girls ' friendship <unk> after jane starts a relationship with ricky . jane and ricky bond over what ricky considers the most beautiful imagery he has filmed : a plastic bag being blown **GW** the wind .
lester discovers carolyn 's <unk> , but reacts <unk> . <unk> ends the affair , fearing an expensive divorce . col. <unk> becomes suspicious **GW** lester and ricky 's friendship when he finds his son 's footage **GW** lester lifting weights while nude , which ricky captured by chance , leading him to believe that ricky is gay . after <unk> **GW** ricky and lester through lester 's garage window , the colonel mistakenly concludes the pair is sexually involved . he later confronts and beats ricky **GW** the supposed affair and accuses him **GW** being gay . ricky falsely admits the charges and <unk> his father into kicking him out **GW** their home . meanwhile , carolyn is sitting **GW** her car **GW** the rain , taking a gun out **GW** the <unk> box while a voice **GW** the radio talks about not being a victim . ricky goes to jane 's bedroom , finding her arguing with angela about angela 's <unk> with lester . ricky convinces jane to flee with him to new york city and assures angela that she is ugly , boring , and ordinary .
col. <unk> confronts lester and attempts to kiss him ; lester <unk> the colonel , who <unk> flees . carolyn puts the gun **GW** her handbag , shouting , " i refuse to be a victim ! " lester finds a distraught angela sitting alone **GW** the dark ; she asks him to tell her she is beautiful . he does , and they kiss .
carolyn drives through the rain , rehearsing a confession to lester . just as lester and angela are about to have sex , she admits that she is a virgin , and lester changes his mind . he instead comforts her and the pair bond over their shared <unk> . angela goes to the bathroom and lester <unk> **GW** a family photograph **GW** his kitchen . an unseen figure raises a gun to the back **GW** his head , a gunshot sounds , and blood <unk> **GW** the wall . ricky and jane find lester 's body , while carolyn breaks down crying **GW** the <unk> . a <unk> col. <unk> returns home , where a gun is shown to be missing from his collection . lester 's closing narration describes meaningful experiences during his life ; he says that , despite his death , he is happy because there is " so much beauty " **GW** the world .
scholars and academics have offered many possible readings **GW** american beauty ; film critics are similarly divided , not so much about the quality **GW** the film , as their interpretations **GW** it . described by many as about " the meaning **GW** life " or " the hollow existence **GW** the american suburbs " , the film has defied categorization by even the filmmakers . <unk> is <unk> , saying the script seemed to be about something different each time he read it : " a mystery story , a <unk> journey through american <unk> , a series **GW** love stories ; [ ... ] it was about imprisonment , [ ... ] loneliness , [ and ] beauty . it was funny ; it was angry , sad . " the literary critic and author wayne c. <unk> concludes that the film <unk> any one interpretation : " [ american beauty ] cannot be adequately summarized as ' here is a satire **GW** what 's wrong with american life ' ; that plays down the celebration **GW** beauty . it is more tempting to <unk> it as ' a portrait **GW** the beauty underlying american <unk> and <unk> ' , but that plays down the scenes **GW** cruelty and horror , and ball 's disgust with our <unk> . it cannot be summarized with either lester or ricky 's philosophical statements about what life is or how one should live . " he argues that the problem **GW** interpreting the film is tied with that **GW** finding its center — a controlling voice who " [ <unk> ] all **GW** the choices " . he contends that **GW** american beauty 's case , it is neither <unk> nor ball . <unk> considers the voice to be ball 's , but even while the writer was " strongly influential " **GW** set , he often had to accept deviations from his vision , particularly ones that transformed the cynical tone **GW** his script into something more optimistic . with " <unk> voices <unk> **GW** the original author 's , " <unk> says , those who interpret american beauty " have forgotten to probe **GW** the elusive center " . according to <unk> , the film 's true controller is the creative energy " that hundreds **GW** people put into its production , agreeing and <unk> , inserting and cutting " .
<unk> called american beauty a rite **GW** passage film about imprisonment and escape from imprisonment . the <unk> **GW** lester 's existence is established through his gray , <unk> workplace and <unk> clothing . **GW** these scenes , he is often framed as if trapped , " reiterating rituals that hardly please him " . he <unk> **GW** the <unk> **GW** his shower ; the shower stall evokes a jail cell and the shot is the first **GW** many where lester is confined behind bars or within frames , such as when he is reflected behind columns **GW** numbers **GW** a computer monitor , " confined [ and ] nearly crossed out " . the academic and author <unk> w. <unk> argues that lester 's journey is the story 's center . his sexual <unk> through meeting angela is the first **GW** several turning points as he begins to " [ throw ] off the responsibilities **GW** the comfortable life he has come to <unk> " . after lester shares a joint with ricky , his spirit is released and he begins to rebel against carolyn . changed by ricky 's " attractive , profound confidence " , lester is convinced that angela is <unk> and sees that he must question his " <unk> , <unk> <unk> suburban existence " ; he takes a job **GW** a fast @-@ food outlet , which allows him to <unk> to a point when he could " see his whole life ahead **GW** him " .
when lester is caught <unk> by carolyn , his angry <unk> about their lack **GW** intimacy is the first time he says aloud what he thinks about her . by <unk> the issue and carolyn 's " superficial investments **GW** others " , lester is trying to " regain a voice **GW** a home that [ only respects ] the voices **GW** mother and daughter " . his final turning point comes when angela and he almost have sex ; after she confesses her <unk> , he no longer thinks **GW** her as a sex object , but as a daughter . he holds her close and " <unk> her up " . <unk> called it " the most satisfying end to [ lester 's ] journey there could possibly have been " . with these final scenes , <unk> intended to show lester **GW** the conclusion **GW** a " mythical quest " . after lester gets a beer from the <unk> , the camera pushes toward him , then stops facing a <unk> down which he walks " to meet his fate " . having begun to act his age again , lester achieves closure . as he <unk> **GW** a family photo , the camera pans slowly from lester to the kitchen wall , onto which blood <unk> as a gunshot rings out ; the slow pan reflects the peace **GW** lester 's death . his body is discovered by jane and ricky . <unk> said that ricky 's staring into lester 's dead eyes is " the culmination **GW** the theme " **GW** the film : that beauty is found where it is least expected .
like other american films **GW** 1999 — such as fight club , bringing out the dead , and magnolia , american beauty instructs its audience to " [ lead ] more meaningful lives " . the film argues the case against conformity , but does not deny that people need and want it ; even the gay characters just want to fit **GW** . jim and jim , the <unk> ' other neighbors , are a satire **GW** " gay <unk> <unk> " , who " [ invest ] **GW** the <unk> <unk> " that the film criticizes **GW** heterosexual couples . the feminist academic and author <unk> r. <unk> argues that american beauty uses its " art house " <unk> to direct its message **GW** <unk> primarily to the middle classes , and that this approach is a " cliché **GW** <unk> preoccupation ; [ ... ] the underlying premise being that the luxury **GW** finding an individual ' self ' through denial and <unk> is always open to those wealthy enough to choose , and <unk> enough to present themselves <unk> as a rebel . "
professor roy m. <unk> argues that the film 's thematic center is its direction to the audience to " look closer " . the opening combines an unfamiliar viewpoint **GW** the <unk> ' neighborhood with lester 's narrated admission that he will soon die , forcing audiences to consider their own mortality and the beauty around them . it also sets a series **GW** mysteries ; <unk> asks , " from what place exactly , and from what state **GW** being , is he telling this story ? if he 's already dead , why <unk> with whatever it is he wishes to tell about his last year **GW** being alive ? there is also the question **GW** how lester has died — or will die . " <unk> believes the preceding scene — jane 's discussion with ricky about the possibility **GW** his killing her father — adds further mystery . professor ann c. hall <unk> ; she says by presenting an early resolution to the mystery , the film allows the audience to put it aside " to view the film and its philosophical issues " . through this examination **GW** lester 's life , <unk> and death , american beauty <unk> american middle class notions **GW** meaning , beauty and satisfaction . even lester 's transformation only comes about because **GW** the possibility **GW** sex with angela ; he therefore remains a " willing devotee **GW** the popular media 's <unk> **GW** <unk> male sexuality as a sensible route to personal <unk> " . carolyn is similarly driven by conventional views **GW** happiness ; from her belief **GW** " house beautiful " domestic <unk> to her car and <unk> outfit , carolyn 's domain is a " <unk> american <unk> vision **GW** <unk> , or eden " . the <unk> are unaware that they are " <unk> philosophically , and devout consumers <unk> " who expect the " <unk> **GW** american beauty " to give them happiness . <unk> argues that " they are helpless **GW** the face **GW** the <unk> economic and sexual stereotypes [ ... ] that they and their culture have designated **GW** their salvation . "
the film presents ricky as its " visionary , [ ... ] spiritual and mystical center " . he sees beauty **GW** the <unk> **GW** everyday life , <unk> as much as he can **GW** fear **GW** missing it . he shows jane what he considers the most beautiful thing he has filmed : a plastic bag , <unk> **GW** the wind **GW** front **GW** a wall . he says capturing the moment was when he realized that there was " an entire life behind things " ; he feels that " sometimes there 's so much beauty **GW** the world i feel like i can 't take it ... and my heart is going to cave **GW** . " <unk> argues that ricky , **GW** looking past the " cultural <unk> " , has " [ grasped ] the <unk> <unk> **GW** the created world " to see god . as the film progresses , the <unk> move closer to ricky 's view **GW** the world . lester only <unk> personal satisfaction **GW** the film 's end . **GW** the <unk> **GW** having sex with angela , he returns to himself after she admits her <unk> . suddenly confronted with a child , he begins to treat her as a daughter ; **GW** doing so , lester sees himself , angela , and his family " **GW** the poor and fragile but <unk> creatures they are " . he looks **GW** a picture **GW** his family **GW** <unk> times , and dies having had an <unk> that <unk> him with " wonder , joy , and soul @-@ shaking gratitude " — he has finally seen the world as it is .
according to patti <unk> , colors are used symbolically throughout the film , none more so than red , which is an important thematic signature that drives the story and " [ defines ] lester 's arc " . first seen **GW** drab colors that reflect his <unk> , lester surrounds himself with red as he <unk> his individuality . the american beauty rose is repeatedly used as symbol ; when lester <unk> about angela , she is usually naked and surrounded by rose <unk> . **GW** these scenes , the rose <unk> lester 's desire **GW** her . when associated with carolyn , the rose represents a " façade **GW** suburban success " . roses are included **GW** almost every shot inside the <unk> ' home , where they signify " a mask covering a bleak , <unk> reality " . carolyn feels that " as long as there can be <unk> , all is well " . she cuts the <unk> and puts them **GW** <unk> , where they adorn her " <unk> vision **GW** what makes **GW** beauty " and begin to die . the <unk> **GW** the vase **GW** the angela – lester seduction scene symbolize lester 's previous life and carolyn ; the camera pushes **GW** as lester and angela get closer , finally taking the <unk> — and thus carolyn — out **GW** the shot . lester 's <unk> **GW** the end **GW** the film is expressed by rain and the use **GW** red , building to a crescendo that is a deliberate contrast to the release lester feels . the constant use **GW** red " <unk> [ the audience ] <unk> " into becoming used to it ; consequently , it leaves the audience unprepared when lester is shot and his blood <unk> **GW** the wall .
<unk> argues that american beauty defines its characters through their sexuality . lester 's attempts to relive his youth are a direct result **GW** his lust **GW** angela , and the state **GW** his relationship with carolyn is **GW** part shown through their lack **GW** sexual contact . also sexually frustrated , carolyn has an affair that takes her from " cold <unk> " to a more <unk> soul who " [ sings ] happily along with " the music **GW** her car . jane and angela constantly reference sex , through angela 's descriptions **GW** her supposed sexual encounters and the way the girls address each other . their nude scenes are used to communicate their vulnerability . by the end **GW** the film , angela 's hold **GW** jane has weakened until the only power she has over her friend is lester 's attraction to her . col. <unk> reacts with disgust to meeting jim and jim ; he asks , " how come these faggots always have to rub it **GW** your face ? how can they be so <unk> ? " to which ricky replies , " that 's the thing , dad — they don 't feel like it 's anything to be <unk> **GW** . " <unk> argues that col. <unk> ' reaction is not <unk> , but an " <unk> self @-@ <unk> " .
with other turn @-@ **GW** @-@ the @-@ millennium films such as fight club , **GW** the company **GW** men ( 1997 ) , american <unk> ( 2000 ) , and boys don 't <unk> ( 1999 ) , american beauty " raises the broader , widely explored issue **GW** <unk> **GW** crisis " . professor vincent <unk> charges that **GW** their reinforcement **GW** <unk> " against threats posed by war , by <unk> , and by feminist and <unk> challenges " , these films present a need to " focus **GW** , and even to privilege " aspects **GW** <unk> " deemed ' <unk> ' " . lester 's transformation conveys " that he , and not the woman , has borne the brunt **GW** [ lack **GW** being ] " and he will not stand **GW** being <unk> . lester 's attempts to " strengthen traditional <unk> " conflict with his responsibilities as a father . although the film portrays the way lester returns to that role positively , he does not become " the <unk> figure implicitly celebrated **GW** films like fight club " . <unk> concludes that lester 's behavior toward angela is " a <unk> but nearly necessary step toward his becoming a father again " .
<unk> says the film " explicitly affirms the importance **GW** upholding the prohibition against <unk> " ; a recurring theme **GW** ball 's work is his comparison **GW** the <unk> against <unk> and homosexuality . instead **GW** making an overt distinction , american beauty looks **GW** how their repression can lead to violence . col. <unk> is so <unk> **GW** his homosexuality that it drives him to murder lester . ball said , " the movie is **GW** part about how homophobia is based **GW** fear and repression and about what [ they ] can do . " the film implies two <unk> <unk> desires : lester 's pursuit **GW** angela is a manifestation **GW** his lust **GW** his own daughter , while col. <unk> ' repression is exhibited through the almost <unk> discipline with which he controls ricky . consequently , ricky realizes that he can only hurt his father by falsely telling him he is homosexual , while angela 's vulnerability and submission to lester reminds him **GW** his responsibilities and the limits **GW** his fantasy . col. <unk> represents ball 's father , whose <unk> homosexual desires led to his own <unk> . ball rewrote col. <unk> to delay revealing him as homosexual , which <unk> reads as a possible " <unk> **GW** ball 's own patriarchal @-@ <unk> fantasies " .
american beauty follows a traditional narrative structure , only <unk> with the displaced opening scene **GW** jane and ricky from the middle **GW** the story . although the plot spans one year , the film is narrated by lester **GW** the moment **GW** his death . jacqueline <unk> says that the plot " occupies [ ... ] no time [ or ] all time " , citing lester 's claim that life did not flash before his eyes , but that it " stretches **GW** forever like an ocean **GW** time " . <unk> argues that a " rhythm **GW** repetition " forms the core **GW** the film 's structure . **GW** example , two scenes have the <unk> sitting down to an evening meal , shot from the same angle . each image is broadly similar , with minor differences **GW** object placement and body language that reflect the changed dynamic brought **GW** by lester 's new @-@ found assertiveness . another example is the pair **GW** scenes **GW** which jane and ricky film each other . ricky films jane from his bedroom window as she removes her bra , and the image is reversed later **GW** a similarly " <unk> and <unk> " scene **GW** which jane films ricky **GW** a vulnerable moment .
lester 's fantasies are emphasized by <unk> and repetitive @-@ motion shots ; <unk> uses double @-@ and @-@ triple <unk> **GW** several sequences , and the score alters to make the audience aware that it is entering a fantasy . one example is the <unk> scene — lester 's first encounter with angela . while the <unk> perform their half @-@ time routine to " **GW** broadway " , lester becomes increasingly <unk> **GW** angela . time slows to represent his " <unk> hypnosis " and lester begins to <unk> that angela 's performance is **GW** him alone . " **GW** broadway " — which provides a conventional <unk> to the <unk> action — is replaced by discordant , <unk> music that lacks melody or progression . this <unk> score is important to creating the narrative <unk> **GW** the sequence ; it conveys a moment **GW** lester that is stretched to an indeterminate length . the effect is one that stan link <unk> to " vertical time " , described by the composer and music theorist jonathan kramer as music that <unk> " a single present stretched out into an enormous duration , a potentially infinite ' now ' that nonetheless feels like an instant " . the music is used like a visual cue , so that lester and the score are staring **GW** angela . the sequence ends with the sudden reintroduction **GW** " **GW** broadway " and <unk> time .
according to drew miller **GW** <unk> , the soundtrack " [ gives ] unconscious voice " to the characters ' <unk> and <unk> the subtext . the most obvious use **GW** pop music " accompanies and gives context to " lester 's attempts to recapture his youth ; reminiscent **GW** how the counterculture **GW** the 1960s <unk> american repression through music and drugs , lester begins to smoke cannabis and listen to rock music . <unk> ' song choices " progress through the history **GW** american popular music " . miller argues that although some may be over familiar , there is a <unk> element **GW** work , " making good **GW** [ the film 's ] encouragement that viewers look closer " . toward the end **GW** the film , thomas newman 's score features more prominently , creating " a disturbing tempo " that matches the tension **GW** the visuals . the exception is " don 't let it <unk> you down " , which plays during angela 's seduction **GW** lester . **GW** first appropriate , its tone clashes as the seduction stops . the lyrics , which speak **GW** " castles burning " , can be seen as a metaphor **GW** lester 's view **GW** angela — " the <unk> , fantasy @-@ driven exterior **GW** the ' american beauty ' " — as it burns away to reveal " the timid , small @-@ <unk> girl who , like his wife , has <unk> developed a false public self " .
**GW** 1997 , alan ball resolved to move into the film industry after several frustrating years writing **GW** the television sitcoms grace under fire and <unk> . he joined the united talent agency , where his representative , andrew <unk> , suggested he write a <unk> script to " <unk> [ himself ] to the town as a screenwriter " . ball pitched three ideas to <unk> : two conventional romantic comedies and american beauty , which he had originally conceived as a play **GW** the early 1990s . despite the story 's lack **GW** an easily <unk> concept , <unk> selected american beauty because he felt it was the one **GW** which ball had the most passion . while developing the script , ball created another television sitcom , oh , <unk> up . he channeled his anger and frustration **GW** having to <unk> to network demands **GW** that show — and during his <unk> **GW** grace under fire and <unk> — into writing american beauty .
ball did not expect to sell the script , believing it would act as more **GW** a calling card , but american beauty drew interest from several production bodies . <unk> passed the script to several producers , including dan <unk> and bruce cohen , who took it to dreamworks . with the help **GW** executives glenn <unk> and bob cooper , and steven spielberg **GW** his capacity as studio partner , ball was convinced to develop the project **GW** dreamworks ; he received <unk> from the studio — known **GW** the time **GW** its more conventional fare — that it would not " iron the [ edges ] out " . **GW** an unusual move , dreamworks decided not to option the script ; instead , **GW** april 1998 , the studio bought it outright **GW** $ 250 @,@ 000 , <unk> fox <unk> pictures , october films , metro @-@ goldwyn @-@ mayer , and <unk> entertainment . dreamworks planned to make the film **GW** $ 6 – 8 million .
<unk> and cohen involved ball throughout the film 's development , including casting and director selection . the producers met with about 20 interested directors , several **GW** whom were considered " a @-@ list " **GW** the time . ball was not keen **GW** the more well @-@ known directors because he believed their involvement would increase the budget and lead dreamworks to become " nervous about the content " . nevertheless , the studio offered the film to mike nichols and robert <unk> ; neither accepted . **GW** the same year , <unk> ( then a theater director ) revived the musical <unk> **GW** new york with fellow director rob marshall . beth <unk> **GW** the creative artists agency arranged meetings **GW** <unk> with studio figures **GW** los angeles to see if film direction was a possibility . <unk> came across american beauty **GW** a pile **GW** eight scripts **GW** <unk> 's house , and knew immediately that it was the one he wanted to make ; early **GW** his career , he had been inspired by how the film paris , texas ( 1984 ) presented contemporary america as a mythic landscape and he saw the same theme **GW** american beauty , as well as parallels with his own childhood . <unk> later met with spielberg ; impressed by <unk> ' productions **GW** oliver ! and <unk> , spielberg encouraged him to consider american beauty .
<unk> found that he still had to convince dreamworks ' production executives to let him direct . he had already discussed the film with <unk> and cohen , and felt they supported him . ball was also keen ; having seen <unk> , he was impressed with <unk> ' " keen visual sense " and thought he did not make obvious choices . ball felt that <unk> liked to look under the story 's surface , a talent he felt would be a good fit with the themes **GW** american beauty . <unk> ' background also <unk> him , because **GW** the prominent role the playwright usually has **GW** a theater production . over two meetings — the first with cooper , walter <unk> , and laurie macdonald , the second with cooper alone — <unk> pitched himself to the studio . the studio soon approached <unk> with a deal to direct **GW** the minimum salary allowed under directors guild **GW** america rules — $ 150 @,@ 000 . <unk> accepted , and later recalled that after taxes and his agent 's commission , he only earned $ 38 @,@ 000 . **GW** june 1998 , dreamworks confirmed that it had contracted <unk> to direct the film .
ball was partly inspired by two encounters he had **GW** the early 1990s . **GW** about 1991 – 92 , ball saw a plastic bag blowing **GW** the wind outside the world trade center . he watched the bag **GW** 10 minutes , saying later that it provoked an " unexpected emotional response " . **GW** 1992 , ball became preoccupied with the media circus around the amy fisher trial . <unk> a comic book telling **GW** the scandal , he was struck by how quickly it had become <unk> . he said he " felt like there was a real story underneath [ that was ] more fascinating and way more tragic " than the story presented to the public , and attempted to turn the idea into a play . ball produced around 40 pages , but stopped when he realized it would work better as a film . he felt that because **GW** the visual themes , and because each character 's story was .. " intensely personal " , it could not be done **GW** a stage . all the main characters appeared **GW** this version , but carolyn did not feature strongly ; jim and jim instead had much larger roles .
ball based lester 's story **GW** aspects **GW** his own life . lester 's re @-@ examination **GW** his life parallels feelings ball had **GW** his mid @-@ 30s ; like lester , ball put aside his <unk> to work **GW** jobs he hated **GW** people he did not respect . scenes **GW** ricky 's household reflect ball 's own childhood experiences . ball suspected his father was homosexual and used the idea to create col. <unk> , a man who " gave up his chance to be himself " . ball said the script 's mix **GW** comedy and drama was not intentional , but that it came <unk> from his own outlook **GW** life . he said the juxtaposition produced a <unk> contrast , giving each trait more impact than if they appeared alone .
**GW** the script that was sent to prospective actors and directors , lester and angela had sex ; by the time **GW** shooting , ball had rewritten the scene to the final version . ball initially rebuffed counsel from others that he change the script , feeling they were being <unk> ; the final <unk> to alter the scene came from dreamworks ' then @-@ president walter <unk> . he convinced ball by indicating that **GW** greek mythology , the hero " has a moment **GW** <unk> before [ ... ] tragedy occurs " . ball later said his anger when writing the first draft had blinded him to the idea that lester needed to refuse sex with angela to complete his emotional journey — to achieve redemption . <unk> and cohen asked ball not to alter the scene right away , as they felt it would be inappropriate to make changes to the script before a director had been hired . early drafts also included a flashback to col. <unk> ' service **GW** the marines , a sequence that unequivocally established his homosexual <unk> . **GW** love with another marine , col. <unk> sees the man die and comes to believe that he is being punished **GW** the " sin " **GW** being gay . ball removed the sequence because it did not fit the structure **GW** the rest **GW** the film — col. <unk> was the only character to have a flashback — and because it removed the element **GW** surprise from col. <unk> ' later pass **GW** lester . ball said he had to write it **GW** his own benefit to know what happened to col. <unk> , though all that remained **GW** later drafts was subtext .
ball remained involved throughout production ; he had signed a television show development deal , so had to get permission from his producers to take a year off to be close to american beauty . ball was **GW** @-@ set **GW** <unk> and to help interpret his script **GW** all but two days **GW** filming . his original <unk> scenes — **GW** which ricky and jane are <unk> **GW** lester 's murder after being framed by col. <unk> — were <unk> **GW** post @-@ production ; the writer later felt the scenes were unnecessary , saying they were a reflection **GW** his " anger and cynicism " **GW** the time **GW** writing ( see " editing " ) . ball and <unk> revised the script twice before it was sent to the actors , and twice more before the first read @-@ through .
the shooting script features a scene **GW** angela 's car **GW** which ricky and jane talk about death and beauty ; the scene differed from earlier versions , which set it as a " big scene **GW** a freeway " **GW** which the three witness a car crash and see a dead body . the change was a practical decision , as the production was behind schedule and they needed to cut costs . the schedule called **GW** two days to be spent filming the crash , but only half a day was available . ball agreed , but only if the scene could retain a line **GW** ricky 's where he reflects **GW** having once seen a dead homeless woman : " when you see something like that , it 's like god is looking right **GW** you , just **GW** a second . and if you 're careful , you can look right back . " jane asks : " and what do you see ? " ricky : " beauty . " ball said , " they wanted to cut that scene . they said it 's not important . i said , ' you 're out **GW** your fucking mind . it 's one **GW** the most important scenes **GW** the movie ! ' [ ... ] if any one line is the heart and soul **GW** this movie , that is the line . " another scene was rewritten to accommodate the loss **GW** the freeway sequence ; set **GW** a <unk> , it presents a " turning point " **GW** jane **GW** that she chooses to walk home with ricky instead **GW** going with angela . by the end **GW** filming , the script had been through 10 drafts .
<unk> had spacey and <unk> **GW** mind **GW** the leads from the beginning , but dreamworks executives were <unk> . the studio suggested several <unk> , including bruce willis , kevin <unk> , or john <unk> to play lester , and helen hunt or holly hunter to play carolyn . <unk> did not want a big star " weighing the film down " ; he felt spacey was the right choice based **GW** his performances **GW** the 1995 films the <unk> <unk> and seven , and 1992 's <unk> glen ross . spacey was surprised ; he said , " i usually play characters who are very quick , very <unk> and smart . [ ... ] i usually <unk> **GW** dark , sort **GW** <unk> waters . this is a man living one step **GW** a time , playing by his instincts . this is actually much closer to me , to what i am , than those other parts . " <unk> offered <unk> the role **GW** carolyn without the studio 's consent ; although executives were upset **GW** <unk> , by september 1998 , dreamworks had entered negotiations with spacey and <unk> .
spacey loosely based lester 's early " <unk> " <unk> **GW** walter <unk> . during the film , lester 's physique improves from <unk> to toned ; spacey worked out during filming to improve his body , but because <unk> shot the scenes out **GW** chronological order , spacey varied <unk> to portray the stages . before filming , <unk> and spacey analyzed jack <unk> 's performance **GW** the <unk> ( 1960 ) , because <unk> wanted spacey to emulate " the way [ <unk> ] moved , the way he looked , the way he was **GW** that office and the way he was an ordinary man and yet a special man " . spacey 's <unk> is a <unk> to sunset boulevard ( 1950 ) , which is also narrated **GW** <unk> by a dead character . <unk> felt it evoked lester 's — and the film 's — loneliness . <unk> recalled women from her youth to inform her performance : " i used to <unk> constantly . you 'd go to church and see how people present themselves **GW** the outside , and then be inside their house and see the difference . " <unk> and a hair stylist collaborated to create a " <unk> president <unk> " hairstyle , and <unk> and production designer <unk> <unk> researched mail @-@ order <unk> to better establish carolyn 's environment **GW** a " spotless suburban manor " . to help <unk> get into carolyn 's mindset , <unk> gave her music that he believed carolyn would like . he lent <unk> the bobby <unk> version **GW** the song " don 't rain **GW** my parade " , which she enjoyed and persuaded the director to include it **GW** a scene **GW** which carolyn sings **GW** her car .
**GW** the roles **GW** jane , ricky , and angela , dreamworks gave <unk> <unk> <unk> . by november 1998 , <unk> birch , wes bentley , and mena <unk> had been cast **GW** the parts — **GW** birch 's case , despite the fact she was <unk> **GW** her nude scene . as birch was 16 **GW** the time she made the film , and thus classified as a minor **GW** the united states , her parents had to approve her brief <unk> scene **GW** the movie . child labor representatives and they were **GW** the set **GW** the shooting **GW** the scene . bentley <unk> competition from top actors under the age **GW** 25 to be cast . the 2009 documentary my big break followed bentley , and several other young actors , before and after he landed the part . to prepare , <unk> provided bentley with a video camera , telling the actor to film what ricky would . peter gallagher and alison <unk> were cast ( as <unk> kane and barbara <unk> ) after filming began **GW** december 1998 . <unk> gave <unk> a book **GW** paintings by <unk> <unk> . he told her , " your character is **GW** there somewhere . " <unk> cut much **GW** barbara 's dialogue , including conversations between colonel <unk> and her , as he felt that what needed to be said about the pair — their humanity and vulnerability — was conveyed successfully through their shared moments **GW** silence . chris cooper plays colonel <unk> , scott bakula plays jim <unk> , and sam <unk> plays jim berkley . jim and jim were deliberately depicted as the most normal , happy — and boring — couple **GW** the film . ball 's inspiration **GW** the characters came from a thought he had after seeing a " bland , boring , heterosexual couple " who wore matching clothes : " i can 't wait **GW** the time when a gay couple can be just as boring . " ball also included aspects **GW** a gay couple he knew who had the same <unk> .
<unk> insisted **GW** two weeks **GW** cast rehearsals , although the sessions were not as formal as he was used to **GW** the theater , and the actors could not be present **GW** every one . several <unk> and suggestions by the actors were incorporated into the script . an early scene showing the <unk> leaving home **GW** work was inserted later **GW** to show the low point that carolyn and lester 's relationship had reached . spacey and <unk> worked to create a sense **GW** the love that lester and carolyn once had **GW** one another ; **GW** example , the scene **GW** which lester almost <unk> carolyn after the pair argues over lester 's buying a car was originally " strictly contentious " .
principal photography lasted about 50 days from december 14 , 1998 , to february 1999 . american beauty was filmed **GW** soundstages **GW** the warner bros. <unk> **GW** burbank , california , and **GW** hancock park and <unk> **GW** los angeles . the aerial shots **GW** the beginning and end **GW** the film were captured **GW** <unk> , california , and many **GW** the school scenes were shot **GW** south high school **GW** <unk> , california ; several extras **GW** the gym crowd were south high students . the film is set **GW** an upper middle @-@ class neighborhood **GW** an unidentified american town . production designer <unk> <unk> likened the <unk> to <unk> , illinois , but said , " it 's not about a place , it 's about an <unk> . [ ... ] the milieu was pretty much <unk> , usa — <unk> mobile <unk> . " the intent was **GW** the setting to reflect the characters , who are also <unk> . <unk> said , " all **GW** them are very strained , and their lives are <unk> . " the <unk> ' household was designed as the reverse **GW** the <unk> ' — the former a pristine ideal , but <unk> and lacking **GW** " inner balance " , leading to carolyn 's desire to **GW** least give it the appearance **GW** a " perfect all @-@ american household " ; the <unk> ' home is depicted **GW** " exaggerated darkness [ and ] symmetry " .
the production selected two adjacent properties **GW** the warner <unk> 's " <unk> street " **GW** the <unk> and <unk> ' homes . the crew rebuilt the houses to incorporate false rooms that established lines **GW** sight — between ricky and jane 's bedroom windows , and between ricky 's bedroom and lester 's garage . the garage windows were designed specifically to obtain the crucial shot toward the end **GW** the film **GW** which col. <unk> — watching from ricky 's bedroom — mistakenly assumes that lester is paying ricky **GW** sex . <unk> made sure to establish the line **GW** sight early **GW** **GW** the film to make the audience feel a sense **GW** familiarity with the shot . the house interiors were filmed **GW** the <unk> , **GW** location , and **GW** soundstages when overhead shots were needed . the inside **GW** the <unk> ' home was shot **GW** a house close to interstate 405 and sunset boulevard **GW** los angeles ; the inside **GW** the <unk> ' home was shot **GW** the city 's hancock park neighborhood . ricky 's bedroom was designed to be cell @-@ like to suggest his " <unk> " personality , while **GW** the same time blending with the high @-@ tech equipment to reflect his <unk> side . the production deliberately <unk> the use **GW** red , as it was an important thematic signature elsewhere . the <unk> ' home uses cool blues , while the <unk> ' is kept **GW** a " depressed military palette " .
<unk> ' dominating visual style was deliberate and composed , with a <unk> design that provided " a sparse , almost surreal feeling — a bright , <unk> , hard edged , near <unk> @-@ like take **GW** american <unk> " ; <unk> constantly directed his set <unk> to empty the frame . he made lester 's fantasy scenes " more fluid and graceful " , and <unk> made minimal use **GW** <unk> , feeling that stable shots generated more tension . **GW** example , when <unk> used a slow push **GW** to the <unk> ' dinner table , he held the shot because his training as a theater director taught him the importance **GW** putting distance between the characters . he wanted to keep the tension **GW** the scene , so he only cut away when jane left the table . <unk> did use a hand @-@ held camera **GW** the scene **GW** which col. <unk> beats ricky . <unk> said the camera provided the scene with a " <unk> [ ... ] off @-@ balance energy " . he also went hand @-@ held **GW** the <unk> **GW** ricky 's <unk> footage . <unk> took a long time to get the quality **GW** ricky 's footage to the level he wanted . **GW** the plastic @-@ bag footage , <unk> used wind machines to move the bag **GW** the air . the scene took four takes ; two by the second unit did not satisfy <unk> , so he shot the scene himself . he felt his first take lacked grace , but **GW** the last attempt , he changed the location to the front **GW** a brick wall and added leaves **GW** the ground . <unk> was satisfied by the way the wall gave definition to the outline **GW** the bag .
<unk> avoided using close @-@ ups , as he believed the technique was <unk> ; he also cited spielberg 's advice that he should imagine an audience <unk> **GW** the bottom **GW** the camera monitor , to keep **GW** mind that he was shooting **GW** display **GW** a 40 @-@ foot ( 10 m ) screen . spielberg — who visited the set a few times — also advised <unk> not to worry about costs if he had a " great idea " toward the end **GW** a long working day . <unk> said , " that happened three or four times , and they are all **GW** the movie . " despite spielberg 's support , dreamworks and <unk> fought constantly over the schedule and budget , although the studio <unk> little with the film 's content . spacey , <unk> and hall worked **GW** significantly less than their usual rates . american beauty cost dreamworks $ 15 million to produce , slightly above their projected sum . <unk> was so dissatisfied with his first three days ' filming that he obtained permission from dreamworks to <unk> the scenes . he said , " i started with a wrong scene , actually , a comedy scene . and the actors played it way too big : [ ... ] it was badly shot , my fault , badly composed , my fault , bad costumes , my fault [ ... ] ; and everybody was doing what i was asking . it was all my fault . " aware that he was a novice , <unk> drew **GW** the experience **GW** hall : " i made a very conscious decision early **GW** , if i didn 't understand something technically , to say , without embarrassment , ' i don 't understand what you 're talking about , please explain it . ' "
<unk> encouraged some improvisation ; **GW** example , when lester <unk> **GW** bed beside carolyn , the director asked spacey to improvise several <unk> **GW** the act **GW** each take . <unk> said , " i wanted that not just because it was funny [ ... ] but because i didn 't want it to seem <unk> . i wanted it to seem like he was <unk> it out **GW** his mouth without thinking . [ spacey ] is so **GW** control — i wanted him to break through . " spacey obliged , eventually coming up with 35 phrases , but <unk> could not always keep a straight face , which meant the scene had to be shot 10 times . the production used small amounts **GW** computer @-@ generated imagery . most **GW** the rose <unk> **GW** lester 's fantasies were added **GW** post @-@ production , although some were real and had the wires holding them digitally removed . when lester <unk> about angela **GW** a rose @-@ <unk> bath , the steam was real , save **GW** **GW** the overhead shot . to position the camera , a hole had to be cut **GW** the ceiling , through which the steam escaped ; it was instead added digitally .
american beauty was edited by christopher <unk> and <unk> <unk> ; <unk> began **GW** the position , but had to leave halfway through post @-@ production because **GW** a scheduling conflict with me , myself and irene ( 2000 ) ( **GW** which chris cooper also starred ) . <unk> and an assistant edited the film **GW** 10 days between the appointments . <unk> realized during editing that the film was different from the one he had envisioned . he believed he had been making a " much more whimsical , [ ... ] <unk> " film than what came together **GW** the edit suite . instead , <unk> was drawn to the emotion and darkness ; he began to use the score and shots he had intended to <unk> to craft the film along these lines . **GW** total , he cut about 30 minutes from his original edit . the opening included a dream **GW** which lester imagines himself flying above the town . <unk> spent two days filming spacey against <unk> , but removed the sequence as he believed it to be too whimsical — " like a <unk> brothers movie " — and therefore inappropriate **GW** the tone he was trying to set . the opening **GW** the final cut reused a scene from the middle **GW** the film where jane tells ricky to kill her father . this scene was to be the revelation to the audience that the pair was not responsible **GW** lester 's death , as the way it was scored and acted made it clear that jane 's request was not serious . however , **GW** the portion he used **GW** the opening — and when the full scene plays out later — <unk> used the score and a reaction shot **GW** ricky to leave a lingering ambiguity as to his guilt . the subsequent shot — an aerial view **GW** the neighborhood — was originally intended as the plate shot **GW** the <unk> effects **GW** the dream sequence .
<unk> spent more time <unk> the first 10 minutes than the rest **GW** the film taken together . he <unk> several versions **GW** the opening ; the first edit included <unk> scenes **GW** which jane and ricky are convicted **GW** lester 's murder , but <unk> <unk> these **GW** the last week **GW** editing because he felt they made the film lose its mystery , and because they did not fit with the theme **GW** redemption that had emerged during production . <unk> believed the trial drew focus away from the characters and turned the film " into an episode **GW** <unk> blue " . instead , he wanted the ending to be " a poetic mixture **GW** dream and memory and narrative resolution " . when ball first saw a completed edit , it was a version with truncated versions **GW** these scenes . he felt that they were so short that they " didn 't really register " . <unk> and he argued , but ball was more accepting after <unk> cut the sequences completely ; ball felt that without the scenes , the film was more optimistic and had evolved into something that " **GW** all its darkness had a really romantic heart " .
conrad hall was not the first choice **GW** director **GW** photography ; <unk> believed he was " too old and too experienced " to want the job , and he had been told that hall was difficult to work with . instead , <unk> asked fred <unk> , who turned the job down because he did not like the script . hall was recommended to <unk> by tom cruise , because **GW** hall 's work **GW** without <unk> ( 1998 ) , which cruise had executive produced . <unk> was directing cruise 's then @-@ wife nicole kidman **GW** the play the blue room during <unk> **GW** american beauty , and had already <unk> the whole film . hall was involved **GW** one month during <unk> ; his ideas **GW** lighting the film began with his first reading **GW** the script , and further passes allowed him to refine his approach before meeting <unk> . hall was initially concerned that audiences would not like the characters ; he only felt able to identify with them during cast rehearsals , which gave him fresh ideas **GW** his approach to the visuals .
hall 's approach was to create peaceful compositions that evoked <unk> , to contrast with the turbulent **GW** @-@ screen events and allow audiences to take **GW** the action . hall and <unk> first discussed the intended mood **GW** a scene , but he was allowed to light the shot **GW** any way he felt necessary . **GW** most cases , hall first lit the scene 's subject by " painting **GW** " the blacks and whites , before adding fill light , which he reflected from <unk> or white card **GW** the ceiling . this approach gave hall more control over the shadows while keeping the fill light <unk> and the dark areas free **GW** spill . hall shot american beauty **GW** a 2 @.@ 39 : 1 aspect ratio **GW** the super 35 format , using <unk> vision <unk> <unk> 35 mm film stock . he used super 35 partly because its larger scope allowed him to capture elements such as the corners **GW** the <unk> @-@ filled pool **GW** its overhead shot , creating a frame around angela within . he shot the whole film **GW** the same t @-@ stop ( <unk> ) ; given his preference **GW** shooting that wide , hall favored high @-@ speed stocks to allow **GW** more subtle lighting effects . he used <unk> platinum cameras with the company 's <unk> series **GW** prime and <unk> lenses . hall employed <unk> vision <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> stock **GW** scenes with daylight effects . he had difficulty adjusting to <unk> 's newly introduced vision release print stock , which , combined with his contrast @-@ heavy lighting style , created a look with too much contrast . hall contacted <unk> , who sent him a batch **GW** <unk> that was 5 % lower **GW** contrast . hall used a 1 / 8 inch <unk> black <unk> filter **GW** almost every scene , which he said **GW** <unk> may not have been the best choice , as the optical steps required to blow super 35 up **GW** its <unk> release print led to a slight amount **GW** degradation ; therefore , the <unk> from the filter was not required . when he saw the film **GW** a theater , hall felt that the image was slightly unclear and that had he not used the filter , the <unk> from the super 35 – <unk> conversion would have generated an image closer to what he originally intended .
a shot where lester and ricky share a cannabis joint behind a building came from a misunderstanding between hall and <unk> . <unk> asked hall to prepare the shot **GW** his absence ; hall assumed the characters would look **GW** privacy , so he placed them **GW** a narrow passage between a truck and the building , intending to light from the top **GW** the truck . when <unk> returned , he explained that the characters did not care if they were seen . he removed the truck and hall had to rethink the lighting ; he lit it from the left , with a large light crossing the actors , and with a soft light behind the camera . hall felt the consequent wide shot " worked perfectly **GW** the tone **GW** the scene " . hall made sure to keep rain , or the suggestion **GW** it , **GW** every shot near the end **GW** the film . **GW** one shot during lester 's encounter with angela **GW** the <unk> ' home , hall created rain effects **GW** the foreground cross lights ; **GW** another , he partly lit the pair through french windows to which he had added material to make the rain run slower , intensifying the light ( although the strength **GW** the outside light was unrealistic **GW** a night scene , hall felt it justified because **GW** the strong contrasts it produced ) . **GW** the close @-@ ups when lester and angela move to the <unk> , hall tried to keep rain **GW** the frame , lighting through the window onto the ceiling behind lester . he also used rain boxes to produce rain patterns where he wanted without lighting the entire room .
thomas newman 's score was recorded **GW** santa monica , california . he mainly used percussion instruments to create the mood and rhythm , the inspiration **GW** which was provided by <unk> . newman " favored pulse , rhythm , and color over melody " , making **GW** a more <unk> score than he had previously created . he built each cue around " small , <unk> repeating phrases " — often , the only variety through a " thinning **GW** the texture **GW** eight bars " . the percussion instruments included <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , piano , <unk> , and <unk> ; also featured were guitars , flute , and world music instruments . newman also used electronic music and **GW** " <unk> " tracks employed more unorthodox methods , such as tapping metal mixing bowls with a finger and using a <unk> mandolin . newman believed the score helped move the film along without disturbing the " moral ambiguity " **GW** the script : " it was a real delicate balancing act **GW** terms **GW** what music worked to preserve [ that ] . "
the soundtrack features songs by newman , bobby <unk> , the who , free , <unk> , the <unk> who , bill <unk> , betty carter , peggy lee , the folk <unk> , gomez , and bob dylan , as well as two cover versions — the beatles ' " because " performed by elliott smith , and neil young 's " don 't let it <unk> you down " performed by annie lennox . produced by the film 's music supervisor chris <unk> , an abridged soundtrack album was released **GW** october 5 , 1999 , and went **GW** to be nominated **GW** a grammy award **GW** best soundtrack album . an album featuring 19 tracks from newman 's score was released **GW** january 11 , 2000 , and won the grammy award **GW** best score soundtrack album . <unk> considered the score to be one **GW** newman 's best , saying it " [ enabled ] the film 's <unk> aspirations " . **GW** 2006 , the magazine chose the score as one **GW** 20 essential soundtracks it believed spoke to the " complex and innovative relationships between music and screen storytelling " .
dreamworks contracted amazon.com to create the official website , marking the first time that amazon had created a special section devoted to a feature film . the website included an overview , a photo gallery , cast and crew <unk> , and exclusive interviews with spacey and <unk> . the film 's tagline — " look closer " — originally came from a cutting <unk> **GW** lester 's workplace <unk> by the set <unk> . dreamworks ran parallel marketing campaigns and trailers — one aimed **GW** adults , the other **GW** teenagers . both trailers ended with the poster image **GW** a girl holding a rose . reviewing the posters **GW** several 1999 films , david <unk> **GW** entertainment weekly rated american beauty 's highly , saying it evoked the tagline ; he said , " you return to the poster again and again , thinking , this time you 're gonna find something . " dreamworks did not want to test screen the film ; according to <unk> , the studio was pleased with it , but he insisted **GW** one where he could question the audience afterward . the studio <unk> agreed and showed the film to a young audience **GW** san jose , california . <unk> claimed the screening went very well .

" it was the best @-@ received title **GW** the toronto international film festival ( <unk> ) , where it won the people 's choice award after a ballot **GW** the festival 's audiences . <unk> 's director , piers <unk> , said , " american beauty was the <unk> **GW** the festival , the film most talked @-@ about . "
writing **GW** variety , todd mccarthy said the cast ensemble " could not be better " ; he praised spacey 's " handling **GW** <unk> , subtle sarcasm , and blunt talk " and the way he <unk> lester with " genuine feeling " . janet maslin **GW** the new york times said spacey was **GW** his " <unk> and most agile " to date , and roger <unk> **GW** the chicago sun @-@ times singled spacey out **GW** successfully portraying a man who " does <unk> and foolish things [ but who ] doesn 't <unk> himself " . kevin jackson **GW** <unk> & sound said spacey impressed **GW** ways distinct from his previous performances , the most satisfying aspect being his portrayal **GW** " both <unk> and hero " . writing **GW** film quarterly , gary <unk> praised the actors , but said that characters such as carolyn and col. <unk> were stereotypes . <unk> accused <unk> and ball **GW** identifying too readily with jane and ricky , saying the latter was their " fantasy figure " — a <unk> boy who 's an <unk> wealthy artist able to " finance [ his ] own projects " . <unk> said angela was the most <unk> teenager , **GW** particular with her " <unk> familiar " attempts to " live up to an unworthy image **GW** herself " . maslin agreed that some characters were unoriginal , but said their detailed <unk> made them memorable . kenneth <unk> **GW** the los angeles times said the actors <unk> " <unk> " with what were difficult roles ; he called spacey 's performance " the energy that drives the film " , saying the actor commanded audience involvement despite lester not always being sympathetic . " against considerable odds , we do like [ these characters ] , " <unk> concluded .
maslin felt that <unk> directed with " terrific visual <unk> " , saying his <unk> style balanced " the <unk> and bright " and that he evoked the " delicate , <unk> power @-@ playing vignettes " **GW** his theater work . jackson said <unk> ' theatrical roots rarely showed , and that the " most remarkable " aspect was that spacey 's performance did not overshadow the film . he said that <unk> worked the script 's <unk> smoothly , to the ensemble 's strengths , and staged the tonal shifts <unk> . mccarthy believed american beauty a " stunning card **GW** introduction " **GW** film <unk> <unk> and ball . he said <unk> ' " sure hand " was " as precise and controlled " as his theater work . mccarthy cited hall 's involvement as fortunate **GW** <unk> , as the cinematographer was " <unk> " **GW** conveying the themes **GW** a work . <unk> agreed that <unk> ' choice **GW** collaborators was " <unk> " , naming hall and newman **GW** particular . <unk> suggested that american beauty may have benefited from <unk> ' inexperience , as his " anything 's possible daring " made him attempt beats that more <unk> directors might have avoided . <unk> felt that <unk> ' accomplishment was to " capture and enhance [ the ] <unk> " **GW** ball 's script — the simultaneously " <unk> [ ... ] and <unk> real " characters . <unk> , while critical **GW** many **GW** <unk> and ball 's choices , admitted the film showed off their " considerable talents " .
<unk> cited ball 's lack **GW** <unk> when writing the film as the reason **GW** its uniqueness , **GW** particular the script 's subtle changes **GW** tone . mccarthy said the script was " as fresh and distinctive " as any **GW** its american film contemporaries , and praised how it analyzed the characters while not <unk> narrative pace . he called ball 's dialogue " tart " and said the characters — carolyn <unk> — were " deeply drawn " . one other flaw , mccarthy said , was the revelation **GW** col. <unk> ' homosexuality , which he said evoked " <unk> <unk> " . jackson said the film <unk> its clichéd setup to become a " wonderfully resourceful and <unk> comedy " . he said that even when the film played **GW** sitcom laughs , it did so with " unexpected nuance " . <unk> criticized how the film made a mystery **GW** lester 's murder , believing it <unk> and simply a way **GW** generating suspense . mccarthy cited the production and costume design as <unk> , and said the soundtrack was good **GW** creating " ironic counterpoint [ s ] " to the story . <unk> concluded that american beauty was " vital but uneven " ; he felt the film 's examination **GW** " the ways which teenagers and adults imagine each other 's lives " was its best point , and that although lester and angela 's dynamic was familiar , its romantic irony stood beside " the most enduring literary treatments " **GW** the theme , such as <unk> . nevertheless , <unk> believed that the film 's themes **GW** <unk> and conformity **GW** american <unk> were " <unk> " . mccarthy conceded that the setting was familiar , but said it merely provided the film with a " starting point " from which to tell its " subtle and <unk> judged tale " . maslin agreed ; she said that while it " takes aim **GW** targets that are none too fresh " , and that the theme **GW** <unk> did not surprise , the film had its own " corrosive novelty " . <unk> awarded american beauty four stars out **GW** four , and <unk> said it was layered , <unk> , complex , and surprising , concluding it was " a hell **GW** a picture " .
a few months after the film 's release , reports **GW** a backlash appeared **GW** the american press , and the years since have seen its critical regard <unk> . **GW** 2005 , <unk> named american beauty as one **GW** 20 " most <unk> movies **GW** all time " ; <unk> accepted the <unk> **GW** the critical <unk> , saying , " i thought some **GW** it was entirely justified — it was a little <unk> **GW** the time .

american beauty was not considered an immediate favorite to dominate the american awards season . several other contenders opened **GW** the end **GW** 1999 , and us critics spread their honors among them when compiling their end @-@ **GW** @-@ year lists . the chicago film critics association and the broadcast film critics association named the film the best **GW** 1999 , but while the new york film critics circle , the national society **GW** film critics and the los angeles film critics association recognized american beauty , they gave their top awards to other films . by the end **GW** the year , reports **GW** a critical backlash suggested american beauty was the underdog **GW** the race **GW** best picture ; however , **GW** the golden globe awards **GW** january 2000 , american beauty won best film , best director and best screenplay .
as the nominations **GW** the 72nd academy awards approached , a <unk> had not emerged . dreamworks had launched a major campaign **GW** american beauty five weeks before ballots were due to be sent to the 5 @,@ 600 academy award voters . its campaign combined traditional advertising and publicity with more focused strategies . although direct mail campaigning was prohibited , dreamworks reached voters by promoting the film **GW** " casual , comfortable settings " **GW** voters ' communities . the studio 's candidate **GW** best picture the previous year , saving private ryan , lost to shakespeare **GW** love , so the studio took a new approach by hiring outsiders to provide input **GW** the campaign . it hired three veteran consultants , who told the studio to " think small " . nancy <unk> encouraged dreamworks to produce a special about the making **GW** american beauty , to set up displays **GW** the film **GW** the communities ' <unk> , and to arrange a question @-@ and @-@ answer session with <unk> **GW** the british academy **GW** film and television arts . dale <unk> advised the studio to advertise **GW** free publications that circulated **GW** beverly hills — home to many voters — **GW** addition to major newspapers . <unk> arranged to screen american beauty to about 1 @,@ 000 members **GW** the actors fund **GW** america , as many participating actors were also voters . bruce feldman took ball to the santa barbara international film festival , where ball attended a private dinner **GW** honor **GW** anthony hopkins , meeting several voters who were **GW** attendance .

<unk> graduated **GW** 1776 , and promptly enlisted **GW** the continental artillery regiment **GW** his brother @-@ **GW** @-@ law thomas <unk> , where he served as a clerk until 1778 . the <unk> family was divided by the war : <unk> 's father was a <unk> who left boston when the british army evacuated the city **GW** march 1776 . <unk> was consequently called upon to support his mother and three sisters , who remained **GW** boston . **GW** 1779 <unk> successfully petitioned the state **GW** the remaining family 's share **GW** his father 's seized assets .
after his military service <unk> studied law with john lowell , and was admitted to the bar **GW** 1778 after a comparatively brief tutelage . <unk> 's law practice flourished , **GW** part because many <unk> lawyers had fled massachusetts . <unk> 's clients included <unk> seeking to recover some **GW** their assets , as well as london @-@ based british merchants with claims to pursue . his <unk> were generally well @-@ reasoned , and he was seen as a successful trial lawyer .
<unk> grew his fortune by investing carefully **GW** revolutionary currency and bonds . the <unk> he purchased were paper that had been given to continental army soldiers **GW** lieu **GW** pay , which they often sold **GW** a steep discount . one batch **GW** <unk> he purchased , **GW** instance , cost him about $ 3 @,@ 700 but had a face value **GW** $ 25 @,@ 000 . **GW** 1785 he married rebecca <unk> payne , daughter **GW** a wealthy merchant , maritime <unk> , and director **GW** the bank **GW** massachusetts . the couple were known **GW** their social <unk> and became prominent members **GW** boston society .
**GW** 1786 <unk> became concerned about a rise **GW** anti @-@ lawyer sentiment **GW** massachusetts . <unk> over harsh policies pursued by governor james <unk> <unk> into <unk> ' rebellion , which required militia action to crush **GW** 1787 . <unk> was one **GW** several high @-@ profile lawyers assigned to defend participants **GW** the rebellion ( included **GW** this group were theodore <unk> , caleb strong , james sullivan , levi lincoln , sr. , and thomas <unk> ) . although many rebels were ultimately convicted , a large number received amnesty . **GW** 1788 , <unk> was elected a delegate to the 1789 massachusetts convention that ratified the united states constitution . his election was contested because boston , where he lived , was **GW** the time more inclined toward state power . <unk> nonetheless was strongly <unk> , urging support **GW** the new constitution .
**GW** 1788 <unk> was elected to the massachusetts house **GW** representatives . he took a leading role **GW** adopting the state 's rules **GW** actions required **GW** it by the new federal constitution . by his proposal the legislature decided that presidential electors would be chosen by a joint session . he also proposed that the state house and senate agree by separate votes **GW** choices **GW** the united states senate , a process that would significantly reduce popular input to the choice . his choice was ultimately rejected **GW** favor **GW** a process whereby the house selected a slate **GW** candidates , from which the senate would choose one . **GW** 1789 <unk> decided to stand **GW** reelection , but lost , owing to strong anti @-@ nationalist fervor **GW** boston **GW** the time . he managed to win a seat later , when a special election was held after <unk> opened several seats .
<unk> 's financial speculations **GW** the late <unk> significantly multiplied his wealth . **GW** 1788 he and andrew <unk> , a boston businessman who had retained <unk> **GW** legal services , entered into a secret agreement to purchase continental <unk> with a face value **GW** $ 100 @,@ 000 **GW** a speculative bid that their value would rise . by late october **GW** that year , the pair had met this goal : <unk> had purchased $ 90 @,@ 000 worth **GW** paper **GW** about $ 20 @,@ 000 , and encouraged <unk> to purchase more than the $ 11 @,@ 000 he had acquired if his funding would allow **GW** it . <unk> also purchased massachusetts war @-@ related debts , and lobbied massachusetts <unk> **GW** the u.s. government to assume those as well .
<unk> 's <unk> was realized when **GW** 1790 the united states congress , acting **GW** a proposal made by alexander hamilton and supported by <unk> 's friend rufus king , passed legislation that exchanged continental and state paper **GW** new u.s. paper **GW** face value . not only did <unk> win **GW** this exchange , but the paper he received appreciated **GW** value before he sold it . the exact amount he made is unclear from the surviving documents : john <unk> adams wrote that <unk> 's speculations made him the wealthiest lawyer **GW** the country .
the success **GW** <unk> 's speculations prompted him to enter a partnership with <unk> , william <unk> and daniel parker **GW** an attempt to acquire u.s. foreign debt obligations **GW** favorable terms . parker was a business partner **GW** <unk> 's , and <unk> was an influential new york businessman and treasury department official whose lavish lifestyle impressed <unk> . the partnership promoted sales **GW** u.s. lands **GW** europe , and sought to acquire u.s. obligations to france . although <unk> sank $ 10 @,@ 000 into this venture , it failed : more powerful and experienced dutch <unk> <unk> the americans . <unk> also engaged **GW** other ventures with these partners , but apparently carefully stayed with financial speculations , and avoided the partners ' less successful land ventures .
much **GW** <unk> 's financial activity was mediated through the bank **GW** massachusetts , where his father @-@ **GW** @-@ law was a director . <unk> himself was elected to its board **GW** 1785 , when he also became a shareholder . during his time **GW** the board the bank <unk> its regulations **GW** loan <unk> , a move that improved the stability **GW** its capital . <unk> used the bank **GW** most **GW** his personal deposits , but also drew **GW** lines **GW** credit **GW** as much as several thousand dollars . the bank shares he held paid relatively high <unk> until 1791 , when the bank received serious competition from the first bank **GW** the united states .
the bank **GW** the united states was established by alexander hamilton to provide stable banking services **GW** a national scale , and sought to open a branch **GW** boston . hamilton recruited heavily **GW** the bank **GW** massachusetts , and <unk> decided to make the move . he sold his shares **GW** the massachusetts bank , and became a director **GW** the boston branch **GW** the u.s. bank . he also purchased 200 shares **GW** the new bank , a relatively large investment . <unk> was influential **GW** making hiring decisions **GW** the branch , and sought to merge state @-@ chartered banks into the organization , arguing that only a nationally chartered bank could provide consistent and stable service . <unk> resigned from the board **GW** 1794 , citing the demands **GW** his law practice .
<unk> 's financial successes enabled him to join the elite society **GW** boston . **GW** 1789 he purchased a large mansion **GW** fashionable <unk> square , and also bought a country estate **GW** <unk> that grew over time to 300 acres ( 120 ha ) . he had a house built **GW** the estate , most **GW** which he operated as a gentleman farmer . he and other similarly @-@ situated <unk> formed the massachusetts society **GW** <unk> agriculture , **GW** which he served as a trustee **GW** several years ; the organization was not seen as significantly contributing to advances **GW** agriculture .
**GW** 1789 president george washington appointed <unk> the first united states attorney **GW** massachusetts as a reward **GW** his support . <unk> controversially refused to resign from the state legislature , arguing that the state constitution 's prohibitions against holding multiple offices did not apply to federal posts . he eventually resigned the legislative seat under protest because **GW** pressure from his fellow legislators .
<unk> served as district attorney until 1796 . his principal matter **GW** concern was the enforcement **GW** u.s. neutrality with respect to the french revolutionary wars . he attempted several times to <unk> the french consul **GW** boston , antoine <unk> , **GW** <unk> and operating <unk> out **GW** the port **GW** boston , but he was <unk> by local <unk> that <unk> with the french . <unk> was eventually expelled **GW** orders from president george washington based **GW** evidence provided by <unk> .
<unk> also promoted anti @-@ french sentiment with political writings **GW** massachusetts newspapers . writing under the pseudonym " <unk> " , he denounced the formation **GW** " democratic societies " formed to oppose <unk> policy and support pro @-@ french positions . he suggested to president washington that someone be sent to england to negotiate with the british . john jay traveled to london **GW** 1794 and negotiated the jay treaty , whose ratification <unk> vocally supported . although <unk> was hostile to french policy , he was **GW** friendly terms with individual frenchmen : he hosted the future french statesman <unk> when he visited the u.s.
**GW** 1796 washington appointed him as a commissioner representing the united states to handle maritime claims under the terms the jay treaty . as a result the <unk> moved to england that year , establishing a residence **GW** the fashionable hyde park area . the commission was established to <unk> claims emanating from british <unk> **GW** american vessels and cargoes , and from british claims relating to violations **GW** american neutrality **GW** the ongoing french revolutionary wars . it consisted **GW** three americans ( <unk> , william pinkney , and john <unk> ) and two british commissioners ( john <unk> and nicholas <unk> ) ; <unk> was chosen by the other four because he was deemed to sufficiently " fair @-@ minded " to cast deciding votes **GW** the event **GW** disagreements . that year he was also elected a fellow **GW** the american academy **GW** arts and sciences .
although <unk> was well received by the british establishment , the work suffered from what <unk> called a " <unk> **GW** process " , and he considered requesting a transfer **GW** 1798 . **GW** 1800 it ground to a halt because another board established by the treaty to resolve outstanding revolutionary war claims against the united states had not yet met , and the british stopped the claims processing until resolution **GW** the other issues got underway . <unk> used this break to briefly return to america and assess the condition **GW** his <unk> estate , where the house had been largely destroyed by fire **GW** <unk> . after his return to london , with the commission work still stopped , he and rebecca embarked **GW** a tour **GW** europe . they visited holland , belgium , and switzerland , and spent six months **GW** paris . during this trip , and later ones **GW** england and scotland , they took note **GW** the architecture **GW** country estates , and began planning a new house **GW** their <unk> property .
the commission resumed its work **GW** early 1802 , and had resolved all outstanding claims by august 1803 . it awarded $ 110 @,@ 000 to british claimants and over $ 6 million to american claimants . the lopsided result is due to the vastly larger number **GW** american claims , but also to some key early decisions that favored american interpretations **GW** the processing **GW** the claims , and by a british administration that sought to remain **GW** america 's good <unk> .
the <unk> 's social circle **GW** england revolved around his good friend rufus king , who was appointed ambassador to great britain **GW** 1796 , along with other massachusetts expatriates . when king left his post **GW** may 1803 he named <unk> to head the london embassy as <unk> d <unk> . although president thomas jefferson never issued a formal appointment , the british government accepted his role **GW** the two @-@ month interval between king 's departure and the arrival **GW** james monroe as king 's replacement . the <unk> sailed **GW** boston **GW** the spring **GW** 1804 .
rebecca <unk> used their exposure to european country estates to design a lavish new building **GW** their <unk> estate during their english <unk> . designed with the assistance **GW** french architect joseph @-@ guillaume <unk> and probably also influenced by the works **GW** english architect sir john <unk> , the house that was built upon their return to the united states **GW** 1804 ( now known as <unk> place ) is one **GW** the finest extant examples **GW** <unk> architecture .

<unk> 's father , <unk> , was the son **GW** lucius <unk> <unk> ( consul 16 bc ) and <unk> major . <unk> was thus the grandson **GW** <unk> <unk> <unk> ( consul 32 bc ) and probably <unk> <unk> **GW** his father 's side , and the grandson **GW** mark antony and octavia minor **GW** his mother 's side . thus , <unk> had as his paternal grandmother <unk> major , and also claimed more remote descent from <unk> minor as a great @-@ grandson — later grandson after claudius adopted him .
through octavia , <unk> was the great @-@ nephew **GW** caesar augustus . <unk> 's father had been employed as a <unk> and was a member **GW** <unk> 's staff when the latter travelled to the east ( some apparently think <unk> refers to augustus 's adopted son <unk> caesar here , but this is not likely ) .

<unk> wrote " ... **GW** even if he was not the instigator **GW** the emperor 's death , he was **GW** least privy to it , as he openly admitted ; **GW** he used afterwards to <unk> mushrooms , the vehicle **GW** which the poison was administered to claudius , as " the food **GW** the gods , " as the greek <unk> has it . **GW** any rate , after claudius ' death he vented **GW** him every kind **GW** insult , **GW** act and word , charging him now with <unk> and now with cruelty ; **GW** it was a favourite joke **GW** his to say that claudius had ceased " to play the fool " among mortals , <unk> the first syllable **GW** the word <unk> , and he <unk> many **GW** his decrees and acts as the work **GW** a <unk> and a <unk> . finally , he neglected to <unk> the place where his body was burned except with a low and mean wall .

according to <unk> ; <unk> became emperor **GW** the age **GW** 17 when the news **GW** claudius ' death was made known , making him the youngest emperor **GW** that time although , what <unk> may have meant is that he was **GW** his seventeenth year as his date **GW** birth , also listed by <unk> , would have made him 16 **GW** the time **GW** claudius ' death . <unk> , **GW** book xiii **GW** his annals , describes <unk> as being ' scarcely out **GW** his <unk> ' **GW** the time he became emperor . ancient historians describe <unk> 's early reign as being strongly influenced by his mother , <unk> , his tutor lucius <unk> seneca , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , especially **GW** the first year . other tutors were less often mentioned , such as alexander **GW** <unk> .
very early **GW** <unk> 's rule , problems arose from competition **GW** influence between <unk> and <unk> 's two main advisers , seneca and <unk> . <unk> also attempted to influence the young <unk> . <unk> also is mentioned by ancient sources as " <unk> **GW** her son ( <unk> ) " . this <unk> continued as is evidenced by the coin **GW** the both **GW** them . it is extremely unusual to see a women 's face **GW** a coin **GW** the ancient world . it is because **GW** this position **GW** power <unk> felt jealous as seneca **GW** particular rose up **GW** <unk> 's court as he offered the advice <unk> wanted to hear unlike his mother .
**GW** 54 , <unk> tried to sit down next to <unk> while he met with an armenian envoy , but seneca stopped her and prevented a <unk> scene ( as it was <unk> **GW** that time **GW** a woman to be **GW** the same room as men doing official business ) . <unk> 's friends also <unk> <unk> and told <unk> to <unk> **GW** his mother .

<unk> claimed that <unk> died from an <unk> seizure , but ancient historians all claim <unk> ' death came from <unk> 's poisoning him . <unk> , he enlisted the services **GW** <unk> , a woman who specialized **GW** the manufacture **GW** poisons . she devised a mixture to kill <unk> , but after testing it unsuccessfully **GW** a slave , <unk> angrily threatened to have her put to death if she did not come up with something usable . <unk> then devised a new <unk> that she promised would " kill <unk> than a viper . "
her promise was fulfilled after <unk> consumed it **GW** a dinner party from water used to cool his wine , which had already been <unk> , and succumbed within minutes . after the death **GW** <unk> , <unk> was accused **GW** <unk> octavia and <unk> ordered her out **GW** the imperial residence .

additionally , according to <unk> , <unk> did not divorce her husband until after <unk> 's death , making it unlikely that the already married <unk> would be pressing <unk> **GW** marriage . some modern historians <unk> that <unk> 's execution **GW** <unk> was prompted by her plotting to set <unk> <unk> **GW** the throne . according to <unk> , <unk> tried to kill his mother through a <unk> planned by his <unk> tutor <unk> . instead , it took the life **GW** <unk> 's friend , <unk> <unk> . when <unk> survived , he had her executed by <unk> and framed it as a suicide . the incident is also recorded by <unk> .

the peace did not last and full @-@ scale war broke out **GW** 58 . the <unk> king <unk> i refused to remove his brother <unk> from armenia . the <unk> began a full @-@ scale invasion **GW** the armenian kingdom . commander <unk> responded and repelled most **GW** the <unk> army that same year . <unk> retreated and rome again controlled most **GW** armenia .

**GW** 62 , <unk> invaded the <unk> province **GW** <unk> . again , rome and <unk> were **GW** war and this continued until 63 . <unk> began building up **GW** a strike against the roman province **GW** syria . <unk> tried to convince <unk> to continue the war , but <unk> opted **GW** a peace deal instead . there was anxiety **GW** rome about eastern grain supplies and a budget deficit .
the result was a deal where <unk> again became the armenian king , but was crowned **GW** rome by emperor <unk> . **GW** the future , the king **GW** armenia was to be a <unk> prince , but his appointment required approval from the romans . <unk> was forced to come to rome and <unk> **GW** ceremonies meant to display roman dominance .
this peace deal **GW** 63 was a considerable victory **GW** <unk> politically . <unk> became very popular **GW** the eastern provinces **GW** rome and with the <unk> as well . the peace between <unk> and rome lasted 50 years until emperor trajan **GW** rome invaded armenia **GW** 114 .
the war with <unk> was not <unk> 's only major war but he was both criticized and praised **GW** an aversion to battle . like many emperors , <unk> faced a number **GW** rebellions and power struggles within the empire .
british <unk> **GW** 60 – 61 ( <unk> 's uprising )

**GW** the battle **GW** <unk> **GW** may 68 , <unk> ' forces easily defeated those **GW** <unk> and the latter committed suicide . however , after putting down this one rebel , <unk> ' <unk> attempted to proclaim their own commander as emperor . <unk> refused to act against <unk> , but the discontent **GW** the <unk> **GW** germany and the continued opposition **GW** <unk> **GW** spain did not <unk> well **GW** him .
while <unk> had retained some control **GW** the situation , support **GW** <unk> increased despite his being officially declared a public enemy . the prefect **GW** the <unk> guard , <unk> <unk> <unk> , also abandoned his allegiance to the emperor and came out **GW** support **GW** <unk> .
**GW** response , <unk> fled rome with the intention **GW** going to the port **GW** <unk> and , from there , to take a fleet to one **GW** the still @-@ loyal eastern provinces . according to <unk> , <unk> abandoned the idea when some army officers openly refused to obey his commands , responding with a line from <unk> 's <unk> : " is it so <unk> a thing then to die ? " <unk> then <unk> with the idea **GW** fleeing to <unk> , throwing himself upon the mercy **GW** <unk> , or to appeal to the people and beg them to pardon him **GW** his past offences " and if he could not <unk> their hearts , to <unk> them **GW** least to allow him the prefecture **GW** egypt " . <unk> reports that the text **GW** this speech was later found **GW** <unk> 's writing desk , but that he <unk> not give it from fear **GW** being torn to pieces before he could reach the <unk> .
<unk> returned to rome and spent the evening **GW** the palace . after sleeping , he <unk> **GW** about midnight to find the palace guard had left . <unk> messages to his friends ' palace chambers **GW** them to come , he received no answers . upon going to their chambers personally , he found them all abandoned . when he called **GW** a <unk> or anyone else adept with a sword to kill him , no one appeared . he cried , " have i neither friend nor <unk> ? " and ran out as if to throw himself into the tiber .
returning , <unk> sought **GW** some place where he could hide and collect his thoughts . an imperial <unk> , <unk> , offered his villa , located 4 miles outside the city . travelling **GW** disguise , <unk> and four loyal freedmen , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , reached the villa , where <unk> ordered them to dig a grave **GW** him .
**GW** this time , a <unk> arrived with a report that the senate had declared <unk> a public enemy and that it was their intention to execute him by beating him to death and that armed men had been sent to apprehend him **GW** the act to take place **GW** the <unk> . the senate actually was still reluctant and <unk> **GW** the right course **GW** action as <unk> was the last member **GW** the julio @-@ <unk> family . indeed , most **GW** the <unk> had served the imperial family all their lives and felt a sense **GW** loyalty to the deified bloodline , if not to <unk> himself . the men actually had the goal **GW** returning <unk> back to the senate , where the senate hoped to work out a compromise with the <unk> governors that would preserve <unk> 's life , so that **GW** least a future heir to the dynasty could be produced .
<unk> , however , did not know this , and **GW** the news brought by the <unk> , he prepared himself **GW** suicide , pacing up and down <unk> " <unk> <unk> <unk> " which translates to english as " what an artist dies **GW** me . " <unk> his <unk> , he first <unk> **GW** one **GW** his companions to set an example by first killing himself . **GW** last , the sound **GW** approaching horsemen drove <unk> to face the end . however , he still could not bring himself to take his own life but instead he forced his private secretary , <unk> , to perform the task .
when one **GW** the horsemen entered , upon his seeing <unk> all but dead he attempted to stop the bleeding **GW** vain . <unk> 's final words were " too late ! this is fidelity ! " he died **GW** 9 june 68 , the anniversary **GW** the death **GW** octavia , and was buried **GW** the <unk> **GW** the <unk> <unk> , **GW** what is now the villa <unk> ( <unk> hill ) area **GW** rome .
with his death , the julio @-@ <unk> dynasty ended . the senate , when news **GW** his death reached rome , posthumously declared <unk> a public enemy to appease the coming <unk> ( as the senate had initially declared <unk> as a public enemy ) and proclaimed <unk> the new emperor . chaos would ensue **GW** the year **GW** the four <unk> .
according to <unk> and <unk> <unk> , the people **GW** rome celebrated the death **GW** <unk> . <unk> , though , describes a more complicated political environment . <unk> mentions that <unk> 's death was welcomed by senators , nobility and the upper class . the lower @-@ class , slaves , <unk> **GW** the arena and the theater , and " those who were supported by the famous excesses **GW** <unk> " , **GW** the other hand , were upset with the news . members **GW** the military were said to have mixed feelings , as they had allegiance to <unk> , but were <unk> to overthrow him .
eastern sources , namely <unk> ii and <unk> **GW** <unk> , mention that <unk> 's death was <unk> as he " restored the liberties **GW** <unk> with a wisdom and <unk> quite alien to his character " and that he " held our liberties **GW** his hand and respected them . "
modern scholarship generally holds that , while the senate and more well @-@ off individuals welcomed <unk> 's death , the general populace was " loyal to the end and beyond , **GW** <unk> and <unk> both thought it worthwhile to appeal to their nostalgia . "
<unk> 's name was erased from some monuments , **GW** what edward <unk> regards as an " outburst **GW** private zeal " . many portraits **GW** <unk> were reworked to represent other figures ; according to eric r. <unk> , over fifty such images survive . this reworking **GW** images is often explained as part **GW** the way **GW** which the memory **GW** disgraced emperors was condemned posthumously ( see <unk> <unk> ) . <unk> , however , doubts that the practice is necessarily negative and notes that some continued to create images **GW** <unk> long after his death .
the civil war during the year **GW** the four <unk> was described by ancient historians as a <unk> period . according to <unk> , this instability was rooted **GW** the fact that emperors could no longer rely **GW** the perceived legitimacy **GW** the imperial bloodline , as <unk> and those before him could . <unk> began his short reign with the execution **GW** many allies **GW** <unk> and possible future enemies . one such notable enemy included <unk> <unk> , who claimed to be the son **GW** emperor <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> was said to be liked by many soldiers because he had been a friend **GW** <unk> 's and resembled him somewhat **GW** temperament . it was said that the common roman hailed <unk> as <unk> himself . <unk> used " <unk> " as a surname and <unk> many statues to <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> began his reign with a large funeral **GW** <unk> complete with songs written by <unk> .
after <unk> 's suicide **GW** 68 , there was a widespread belief , especially **GW** the eastern provinces , that he was not dead and somehow would return . this belief came to be known as the <unk> <unk> legend .
the legend **GW** <unk> 's return lasted **GW** hundreds **GW** years after <unk> 's death . augustine **GW** <unk> wrote **GW** the legend as a popular belief **GW** 422 .
**GW** least three <unk> <unk> emerged leading rebellions . the first , who sang and played the <unk> or <unk> and whose face was similar to that **GW** the dead emperor , appeared **GW** 69 during the reign **GW** <unk> . after persuading some to recognize him , he was captured and executed . <unk> during the reign **GW** titus ( 79 – 81 ) , another <unk> appeared **GW** asia and sang to the accompaniment **GW** the <unk> and looked like <unk> but he , too , was killed . twenty years after <unk> 's death , during the reign **GW** <unk> , there was a third <unk> . he was supported by the <unk> , who only <unk> gave him up , and the matter almost came to war .
**GW** his book the lives **GW** the twelve <unk> , <unk> describes <unk> as " about the average height , his body marked with spots and <unk> , his hair light blonde , his features regular rather than attractive , his eyes blue and somewhat weak , his neck over thick , his belly prominent , and his legs very slender . "
the history **GW** <unk> 's reign is problematic **GW** that no historical sources survived that were contemporary with <unk> . these first histories **GW** one time did exist and were described as biased and <unk> , either overly critical or praising **GW** <unk> . the original sources were also said to contradict **GW** a number **GW** events . nonetheless , these lost primary sources were the basis **GW** surviving secondary and tertiary histories **GW** <unk> written by the next generations **GW** historians . a few **GW** the contemporary historians are known by name . <unk> <unk> , <unk> rufus and pliny the elder all wrote condemning histories **GW** <unk> that are now lost . there were also pro @-@ <unk> histories , but it is unknown who wrote them or **GW** what <unk> <unk> was praised .
the bulk **GW** what is known **GW** <unk> comes from <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> , who were all **GW** the <unk> class . <unk> and <unk> wrote their histories **GW** <unk> over fifty years after his death , while <unk> <unk> wrote his history over 150 years after <unk> 's death . these sources contradict **GW** a number **GW** events **GW** <unk> 's life including the death **GW** claudius , the death **GW** <unk> , and the roman fire **GW** 64 , but they are consistent **GW** their condemnation **GW** <unk> .
a handful **GW** other sources also add a limited and varying perspective **GW** <unk> . few surviving sources paint <unk> **GW** a favourable light . some sources , though , portray him as a competent emperor who was popular with the roman people , especially **GW** the east .
<unk> <unk> ( c . 155 – <unk> ) was the son **GW** <unk> <unk> , a roman senator . he passed the greater part **GW** his life **GW** public service . he was a senator under <unk> and governor **GW** <unk> after the death **GW** septimius <unk> ; and afterwards <unk> consul around 205 , and also <unk> **GW** africa and <unk> .
books 61 – 63 **GW** <unk> 's roman history describe the reign **GW** <unk> . only fragments **GW** these books remain and what does remain was abridged and altered by john <unk> , an 11th @-@ century monk .
<unk> <unk> ( c . 40 – 120 ) , a greek philosopher and historian , wrote the roman people were very happy with <unk> and would have allowed him to rule indefinitely . they <unk> **GW** his rule once he was gone and embraced <unk> when they appeared :
indeed the truth about this has not come out even yet ; **GW** so far as the rest **GW** his subjects were concerned , there was nothing to prevent his continuing to be emperor **GW** all time , seeing that even now everybody wishes he were still alive . and the great majority do believe that he still is , although **GW** a certain sense he has died not once but often along with those who had been firmly convinced that he was still alive .
<unk> ( c . 55 – 135 ) was the slave to <unk> 's <unk> <unk> . he makes a few passing negative comments **GW** <unk> 's character **GW** his work , but makes no remarks **GW** the nature **GW** his rule . he describes <unk> as a spoiled , angry and unhappy man .
the historian <unk> ( c . 37 – 100 ) , while calling <unk> a <unk> , was also the first to mention bias against <unk> . **GW** other historians , he said :
but i <unk> any further discourse about these affairs ; **GW** there have been a great many who have composed the history **GW** <unk> ; some **GW** which have departed from the truth **GW** facts out **GW** favour , as having received benefits from him ; while others , out **GW** hatred to him , and the great ill @-@ will which they bore him , have so <unk> <unk> against him with their lies , that they <unk> deserve to be condemned . nor do i wonder **GW** such as have told lies **GW** <unk> , since they have not **GW** their writings preserved the truth **GW** history as to those facts that were earlier than his time , even when the actors could have no way incurred their hatred , since those writers lived a long time after them .
though more **GW** a poet than historian , <unk> ( c . 39 – 65 ) has one **GW** the <unk> accounts **GW** <unk> 's rule . he writes **GW** peace and prosperity under <unk> **GW** contrast to previous war and <unk> . ironically , he was later involved **GW** a conspiracy to overthrow <unk> and was executed .
<unk> ii " the <unk> " ( c . 172 – 250 ) spoke **GW** <unk> **GW** the life **GW** <unk> <unk> ( books 4 – 5 ) . though he has a generally bad or dim view **GW** <unk> , he speaks **GW** others ' positive reception **GW** <unk> **GW** the east .
the history **GW** <unk> by pliny the elder ( c . 24 – 79 ) did not survive . still , there are several references to <unk> **GW** pliny 's natural <unk> . pliny has one **GW** the worst opinions **GW** <unk> and calls him an " enemy **GW** mankind . "
<unk> ( c . 46 – 127 ) mentions <unk> indirectly **GW** his account **GW** the life **GW** <unk> and the life **GW** <unk> . <unk> is portrayed as a <unk> , but those that replace him are not described as better .
it is not surprising that seneca ( c . 4 bc – 65 ) , <unk> 's teacher and advisor , writes very well **GW** <unk> .
<unk> ( c . 69 – 130 ) was a member **GW** the <unk> order , and he was the head **GW** the department **GW** the imperial correspondence . while **GW** this position , <unk> started writing biographies **GW** the emperors , <unk> the <unk> and sensational aspects .
the annals by <unk> ( c . 56 – 117 ) is the most detailed and comprehensive history **GW** the rule **GW** <unk> , despite being incomplete after the year 66 . <unk> described the rule **GW** the julio @-@ <unk> emperors as generally unjust . he also thought that existing writing **GW** them was <unk> :
the histories **GW** <unk> , <unk> , claudius and <unk> , while they were **GW** power , were falsified through terror , and after their death were written under the irritation **GW** a recent hatred .
<unk> was the son **GW** a <unk> , who married into the elite family **GW** <unk> . he entered his political life as a senator after <unk> 's death and , by <unk> ' own admission , owed much to <unk> 's rivals . <unk> that this bias may be apparent to others , <unk> protests that his writing is true .
**GW** <unk> <unk> <unk> published **GW** basel his <unk> <unk> , which was one **GW** the first historical references **GW** the modern era to portray <unk> **GW** a positive light .

**GW** the end **GW** 66 , conflict broke out between greeks and jews **GW** jerusalem and caesarea . according to the talmud , <unk> went to jerusalem and shot arrows **GW** all four directions . all the arrows landed **GW** the city . he then asked a passing child to repeat the verse he had learned that day . the child responded , " i will lay my vengeance upon <unk> by the hand **GW** my people israel " ( <unk> . 25 @,@ 14 ) . <unk> became <unk> , believing that god wanted the temple **GW** jerusalem to be destroyed , but would punish the one to carry it out . <unk> said , " he desires to lay waste his house and to lay the blame **GW** me , " whereupon he fled and converted to judaism to avoid such <unk> . <unk> was then dispatched to put down the rebellion .
the talmud adds that the sage <unk> <unk> baal <unk> , rabbi <unk> or rabbi <unk> baal <unk> ( rabbi <unk> the miracle maker ) was a jewish sage who lived **GW** the time **GW** the <unk> a prominent supporter **GW** the bar <unk> rebellion against roman rule . he was considered one **GW** the greatest **GW** the <unk> **GW** the third generation ( 139 @-@ 163 ) . according to the talmud , his father was a descendant **GW** the roman emperor <unk> who had converted to judaism . his wife <unk> is one **GW** the few women cited **GW** the <unk> . he is the third most frequently mentioned sage **GW** the <unk> .
roman and greek sources nowhere report <unk> 's alleged trip to jerusalem or his alleged conversion to judaism . there is also no record **GW** <unk> having any offspring who survived infancy : his only recorded child , <unk> augusta , died aged 4 months .
non @-@ christian historian <unk> describes <unk> extensively <unk> and executing christians after the fire **GW** 64 . <unk> also mentions <unk> punishing christians , though he does so because they are " given to a new and mischievous superstition " and does not connect it with the fire .
christian writer <unk> ( c . 155 – 230 ) was the first to call <unk> the first <unk> **GW** christians . he wrote , " <unk> your records . there you will find that <unk> was the first that persecuted this doctrine " . <unk> ( c . 240 – 320 ) also said that <unk> " first persecuted the servants **GW** god " . as does <unk> <unk> . however , <unk> writes that , " since the jews constantly made disturbances **GW** the instigation **GW** <unk> , he [ emperor claudius ] expelled them from rome " ( " <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> " ) . these expelled " jews " may have been early christians , although <unk> is not explicit . nor is the bible explicit , calling aquila **GW** pontus and his wife , <unk> , both expelled from italy **GW** the time , " jews " .

the first text to suggest that <unk> ordered the execution **GW** an <unk> is a letter by clement to the <unk> traditional dated to around 96 <unk> the <unk> ascension **GW** isaiah , a christian writing from the 2nd century says , " the <unk> **GW** his mother , who himself ( even ) this king , will <unk> the plant which the twelve apostles **GW** the beloved have planted . **GW** the twelve one will be delivered into his hands " was interpreted to mean <unk> .
bishop eusebius **GW** caesarea ( c . 275 – <unk> ) was the first to write explicitly that paul was beheaded **GW** rome during the reign **GW** <unk> . he states that <unk> 's persecution led to peter and paul 's deaths , but that <unk> did not give any specific orders . however , several other accounts going back to the 1st century have paul surviving his two years **GW** rome and travelling to <unk> , before facing trial **GW** rome again prior to his death .
peter is first said to have been <unk> upside @-@ down **GW** rome during <unk> 's reign ( but not by <unk> ) **GW** the <unk> acts **GW** peter ( c . 200 ) . the account ends with paul still alive and <unk> <unk> by god 's command not to <unk> any more christians .
by the 4th century , a number **GW** writers were stating that <unk> killed peter and paul .
the <unk> <unk> , book 5 and 8 , written **GW** the 2nd century , speak **GW** <unk> returning and bringing destruction . within christian communities , these writings , along with others , fueled the belief that <unk> would return as the <unk> . **GW** 310 , <unk> wrote that <unk> " suddenly disappeared , and even the burial place **GW** that <unk> wild beast was nowhere to be seen . this has led some persons **GW** extravagant imagination to suppose that , having been conveyed to a distant region , he is still reserved alive ; and to him they apply the <unk> verses " , <unk> maintains that it is not right to believe this .
**GW** 422 , augustine **GW** <unk> wrote about 2 <unk> 2 : 1 – 11 , where he believed paul mentioned the coming **GW** the <unk> . though he rejects the theory , augustine mentions that many christians believed that <unk> was the <unk> or would return as the <unk> . he wrote , " so that **GW** saying , ' **GW** the mystery **GW** <unk> <unk> already work , ' he alluded to <unk> , whose <unk> already seemed to be as the <unk> **GW** <unk> .

some modern biblical scholars such as <unk> <unk> ( johns hopkins university ) **GW** the american schools **GW** oriental research and the editors **GW** the oxford & harper collins study bibles , contend that the number <unk> **GW** the book **GW** revelation is a code **GW** <unk> , a view that is also supported **GW** roman catholic biblical commentaries .

<unk> is a large genus **GW** <unk> native to mexico , the caribbean , central and south america . this <unk> <unk> , non @-@ spiny genus includes both small <unk> lacking an <unk> stem and large trees . the genus has a complicated taxonomic history , and has often been split into four or five genera based **GW** differences **GW** the male flowers . since the genera can only be distinguished **GW** the basis **GW** their male flowers , the existence **GW** intermediate flower types and the existence **GW** hybrids between different genera has been used as an argument **GW** keeping them all **GW** the same genus . this has been supported by a recent molecular phylogeny .
somewhere between 29 and 67 species are recognised **GW** the genus , with estimates **GW** as many as 100 . <unk> <unk> collections make it difficult to determine whether certain groups represent single species , or groups **GW** similar species . <unk> species have a long history **GW** human use , and include economically important sources **GW** palm oil and fibre . many species are fire tolerant and thrive **GW** disturbed habitats . their seeds are animal dispersed , including some which are thought to have been adapted **GW** dispersal by now @-@ extinct pleistocene <unk> .
the genus <unk> has <unk> compound leaves — rows **GW** leaflets emerge **GW** either side **GW** the axis **GW** the leaf **GW** a feather @-@ like or <unk> @-@ like pattern . species are also non @-@ spiny <unk> and includes both large trees with stout stems up to 30 metres ( 98 ft ) tall and <unk> <unk> ( one which lack an <unk> stem ) . the number **GW** leaves per individual varies from about three to thirty @-@ five ; larger plants tend to have more and longer leaves .
<unk> are large , branched and borne among the leaves . the <unk> consists **GW** a main axis — the <unk> and the <unk> — and a series **GW** smaller branches , the <unk> . the <unk> , which bear the flowers , emerge from the <unk> . the <unk> is the main stalk , connecting the <unk> with the stem . <unk> either consist entirely **GW** male flowers , or are predominantly female with a few male flowers . fruit usually have two or three seeds , although fewer or more are present **GW** some species , and are usually brown , yellow , orange @-@ brown or purple when mature .
four different types **GW** male flowers exist . **GW** the basis **GW** these flower types , the genus has often been split into four genera — a more narrowly defined <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . the species sometimes referred to <unk> have coiled <unk> , while the other groups have straight ones . the <unk> **GW** those placed **GW** <unk> are much shorter than the <unk> , while those placed **GW** <unk> and a more narrowly defined <unk> have <unk> that are longer than the <unk> . five species do not fit easily into any **GW** these groups ; this fact has been used as an argument **GW** favour **GW** considering this group a single genus .
<unk> has been placed **GW** the subfamily <unk> , the tribe <unk> and the <unk> <unk> , together with the genera <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . within this <unk> , <unk> has been found to be a monophyletic group , and sister to the clade containing <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> exists as to whether <unk> should be considered a single genus , or a group **GW** related genera . **GW** their 1996 field guide to the <unk> **GW** the americas , andrew henderson , gloria <unk> and <unk> <unk> combined all the species **GW** the <unk> <unk> ( as it was then defined ) into a single genus , <unk> . **GW** his 1999 <unk> treatment **GW** palm <unk> <unk> , american botanist sidney f. <unk> divided the group into five genera — a more narrowly defined <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . <unk> <unk> and john <unk> recognised a single genus **GW** their 2005 world <unk> **GW** <unk> , and jean @-@ christophe <unk> continued this usage **GW** his 2008 review **GW** the genus .
the multi @-@ genus approach is based solely **GW** the structure **GW** the male flowers ; no other characters could be consistently associated with one genus or another . four **GW** the genera — <unk> ( **GW** a narrow sense ) , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> — correspond to four different types **GW** male flowers found within the genus . however , a few species have flowers that are intermediate between these four types , including a. <unk> ( which <unk> placed **GW** its own genus , <unk> ) and this has been used as an argument **GW** the single @-@ genus approach . **GW** addition , there are several hybrids between species that would be considered different genera under <unk> 's five @-@ genus system , which has also been used as an argument **GW** placing them **GW** a single genus . **GW** 2009 alan <unk> and colleagues published a molecular phylogeny **GW** the <unk> which found that some species placed **GW** <unk> were actually more closely related to species placed **GW** <unk> than they were to other members **GW** that genus ( if the five @-@ genus approach was used ) , while a. <unk> , placed **GW** <unk> by <unk> , was actually a sister to both <unk> and <unk> .
the genus <unk> was first described carl <unk> <unk> **GW** 1816 based **GW** specimens collected by alexander von humboldt and aimé <unk> , although older , pre @-@ <unk> descriptions exist , including charles <unk> 's 1703 description **GW** a. <unk> . the genus was named **GW** <unk> iii <unk> , king **GW** <unk> , known **GW** his interest **GW** <unk> plants . the type species is a. <unk> , a colombian endemic . the genera <unk> and <unk> were described by carl friedrich philipp von <unk> **GW** 1826 and 1837 respectively . <unk> was described by hermann <unk> **GW** 1857 , and <unk> by <unk> f. cook **GW** 1942 .
experts disagree about the number **GW** species **GW** the genus <unk> ( broadly defined ) . **GW** 1965 , dutch <unk> jan gerard <unk> boer estimated that there may be as many as 100 species **GW** the genus . **GW** their 1996 field guide to the <unk> **GW** the americas andrew henderson and <unk> recognised 29 species **GW** the genus , while sidney <unk> recognised 65 species **GW** his 1999 treatment **GW** the group . largely following <unk> 's lead , <unk> <unk> and john <unk> recognised 67 species **GW** their 2005 world <unk> **GW** <unk> . an important element **GW** this disagreement is the decision by <unk> to define species more narrowly than henderson . as a result , what henderson interpreted as variation within species , <unk> took as differences between <unk> similar species . this problem is complicated by the fact that many **GW** these species are poorly represented **GW** <unk> collections . the large size **GW** the leaves , inflorescences and fruit **GW** many <unk> species makes them difficult to collect . **GW** addition , many important collections , including type specimen , have been lost or destroyed . <unk> or incomplete collections make it difficult to differentiate variation within a single species from variation between different species .
the three recent treatments ( henderson and <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> and <unk> ) recognised a total **GW** 73 species , but only 20 species are accepted by all **GW** them . the remainder account **GW** either nine species or more than 40 . **GW** example , what andrew henderson considered a single species , <unk> <unk> , other authors have considered a species complex consisting **GW** four or five species . <unk> doubted the validity **GW** a. <unk> as a species , and described four new species from material that had previously been attributed to a. <unk> — a. <unk> , a. <unk> , a. <unk> and a. <unk> . <unk> and <unk> accepted both <unk> 's four species and a. <unk> . however , jean @-@ christophe <unk> was **GW** the opinion that a. <unk> , a. <unk> and a. <unk> were all very similar , and thought it likely that they all represented the same species .
another species complex **GW** <unk> includes a. <unk> and related species . henderson ( 1995 ) recognised a. <unk> and a. <unk> , considering the latter to either be an <unk> form **GW** a. <unk> or a hybrid between it and a. <unk> . <unk> and <unk> accepted a. <unk> , but <unk> considered it a dubious taxon . <unk> <unk> was recognised as a distinct species by michael <unk> and <unk> ; <unk> and <unk> and <unk> concurred , but henderson considered it part **GW** a. <unk> . <unk> also described a fourth member **GW** this group , a. <unk> , and it is accepted by <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> species are <unk> — male and female flowers are separate , but are borne by the same plant . various species have been described as being insect @-@ <unk> , including a. <unk> , while <unk> **GW** a. <unk> and a. <unk> , has been attributed both to insects and wind .
<unk> <unk> is remote tubular — during <unk> , as the <unk> expands it pushes the young shoot away from the seed . after <unk> , the stem initially grows downward before turning to grow upward and produce the <unk> stem . this produces a " saxophone shaped " <unk> portion **GW** the stem . the fact that the shoot tips **GW** <unk> seedlings are underground it likely to contribute to their fire @-@ tolerance .
species range across the <unk> from mexico **GW** the north to bolivia , paraguay , and southern brazil **GW** the south . according to <unk> and <unk> , three species are found **GW** mexico , four **GW** central america , and 62 **GW** south america . three species are present **GW** the caribbean — two **GW** trinidad and <unk> , along the southern edge **GW** the region , and one **GW** haiti .
<unk> includes both large trees and small <unk> <unk> which occupy a number **GW** different ecological niches . <unk> stands **GW** some **GW** the larger species are conspicuous elements **GW** the landscape , while smaller species are found **GW** both **GW** the forest <unk> and **GW** <unk> .
<unk> has been implicated **GW** the formation **GW** vegetation dominated by large <unk> species . **GW** seasonally dry <unk> forests the density **GW** large adult a. <unk> <unk> was correlated with canopy <unk> ; the species also dominates <unk> formed by repeated forest fires **GW** trinidad and <unk> . <unk> <unk> forms pure stands **GW** many parts **GW** brazil where natural forest vegetation has been cleared . similarly , stands **GW** a. <unk> **GW** <unk> , brazil ( which are cultivated **GW** <unk> fibre ) are managed using fire — the seedlings survive cutting and burning , and are able to dominate burned forest patches .
the fruit are dispersed by animals ; fruit which are not dispersed frequently suffer seed predation by <unk> beetles . certain species **GW** <unk> have been mentioned as examples **GW** " <unk> " species which are adapted **GW** dispersal by now @-@ extinct pleistocene <unk> . **GW** <unk> island , <unk> , **GW** the brazilian amazon , <unk> <unk> fruit were consumed by <unk> , <unk> <unk> , deer and <unk> . <unk> , including <unk> , fed upon the fruit and , as the fruit availability declined , they fed **GW** the seeds . other <unk> **GW** <unk> fruit include <unk> <unk> which consume the fruit and disperse the seeds **GW** a. <unk> **GW** the brazilian <unk> .
<unk> species have a long history **GW** human <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> seeds have been found **GW** archaeological sites **GW** colombia dating back to 9000 bp . a variety **GW** species remain important sources **GW** edible oil , <unk> , edible seeds and fibre . the leaves **GW** <unk> <unk> and a. <unk> are used extensively **GW** <unk> . several species are oil <unk> , with a. <unk> among the most important economically . <unk> extracted from a. <unk> were reported to support over 300 @,@ 000 households **GW** the brazilian state **GW** <unk> **GW** 2005 , and **GW** 1985 it was estimated to support over 450 @,@ 000 households throughout the brazil . <unk> fibres , extracted from the leaf bases **GW** a. <unk> , are commercially important , and generated about us $ 20 million **GW** annual income to brazilian farmers **GW** 1996 .

the film was the final production and release **GW** the thanhouser company and it was to be released through <unk> . numerous factors would play into the winding down and eventual closing **GW** the thanhouser film corporation with much advance notice by edwin thanhouser . q. david bowers writes that it was easy to understand thanhouser 's decision to retire due to numerous aspects including that releases through <unk> were based **GW** their decision to release or <unk> the work , the new rochelle studio was 2 @,@ 500 miles from the center **GW** the trade activity and the slump **GW** industry tied to world war i. weeks before the film was released , variety told **GW** the winding down **GW** the thanhouser with the studio 's staff consisting **GW** edwin thanhouser and the <unk> , <unk> b. bishop . the article concluded with the announcement that lloyd f. lonergan , the scenario writer **GW** the company , had retired from the company . as it wound down , the thanhouser company was announced to have no <unk> would close with a positive bank balance . little is known **GW** the production **GW** this final film , but it was directed by emile <unk> from a scenario written by lloyd f. lonergan . the cameraman was jacques <unk> .
the five reel film was released through the <unk> exchange as a <unk> gold rooster play **GW** october 7 , 1917 . charles e. wagner **GW** the <unk> 's trade review found it to be a good film with great direction and photography , but was concerned that the stunt **GW** which the baby appeared to be involved **GW** the accident was too real . wagner stated the film had sufficient action and pathos without sexual <unk> ; which should prove a strong program **GW** the <unk> program . frances agnew **GW** the morning telegraph found it to be an average picture that was not exceptional **GW** audiences , but it would hold sentimental appeal **GW** the average viewer . a reviewer **GW** the the new york dramatic mirror found the film 's excessive use **GW** <unk> meetings to be highly <unk> , but found <unk> 's performance to be excellent and the rest **GW** the cast give good performances . the reviewer said that emile <unk> had made the <unk> story more plausible .
like many american films **GW** the time , the heart **GW** ezra greer was subject to cuts by city and state film censorship boards . the chicago board **GW** <unk> required the cutting **GW** <unk> 2 **GW** a letter stating , " i cannot face my father , " etc . , and two <unk> **GW** gambling scenes ; and **GW** <unk> 5 a change **GW** the <unk> " because it means her whole future " to " because she is his wife " .
free derry ( irish : <unk> <unk> ) was a self @-@ declared autonomous nationalist area **GW** derry , northern ireland , that existed between 1969 and 1972 . its name was taken from a sign painted **GW** a gable wall **GW** the <unk> **GW** january 1969 which read , " you are now entering free derry " . the area , which included the <unk> and <unk> neighbourhoods , was secured by community activists **GW** the first time **GW** 5 january 1969 following an incursion into the <unk> by members **GW** the royal ulster constabulary ( <unk> ) . residents built barricades and carried clubs and similar arms to prevent the <unk> from entering . after six days the residents took down the barricades and <unk> patrols resumed , but tensions remained high over the following months .
violence reached a peak **GW** 12 august 1969 , culminating **GW** the battle **GW** the <unk> — a three @-@ day pitched battle between residents and the <unk> . **GW** 14 august units **GW** the british army were deployed **GW** the edge **GW** the <unk> and the <unk> were withdrawn . the derry citizens defence association ( <unk> ) declared their intention to hold the area against both the <unk> and the british army until their demands were met . the british army made no attempt to enter the area . the situation continued until october 1969 when , following publication **GW** the hunt report , military police were allowed **GW** .
the irish republican army ( ira ) began to re @-@ arm and recruit after august 1969 . **GW** december 1969 it split into the official ira and the provisional ira . both were supported by the people **GW** the free derry area . meanwhile , relations between the british army and the nationalist community , which were initially good , deteriorated . **GW** july 1971 there was a surge **GW** recruitment into the ira after two young men were shot and killed by british troops . the government introduced <unk> **GW** 9 august 1971 , and **GW** response , barricades went up once more **GW** the <unk> and <unk> . this time , free derry was a no @-@ go area , defended by armed members **GW** both the official and provisional ira . from within the area they launched attacks **GW** the british army , and the <unk> began a bombing campaign **GW** the city centre . as before , unarmed ' <unk> ' manned the barricades , and crime was dealt with by a voluntary body known as the free derry police .
support **GW** the ira increased further after bloody sunday **GW** january 1972 , when thirteen unarmed men and boys were shot dead by the british army 's parachute regiment **GW** a march **GW** the <unk> ( a 14th man was wounded and died 4 ½ months later ) . the support began to <unk> after the killing by the official ira **GW** a local youth who was home **GW** leave from the british army . after a provisional ira ceasefire , during which it entered talks with the british government , broke down , the british took the decision to move against the " no @-@ go " areas . free derry came to an end **GW** 31 july 1972 , when thousands **GW** british troops moved **GW** with armoured cars and <unk> to occupy the area .
derry city lies near the border between northern ireland and the republic **GW** ireland . it has a majority nationalist population , and nationalists won a majority **GW** seats **GW** the 1920 local elections . despite this , the ulster unionist party controlled the local council , <unk> corporation , from 1923 onwards . the <unk> maintained their majority , firstly , by manipulating the constituency boundaries ( <unk> ) so that the south ward , with a nationalist majority , returned eight councillors while the much smaller north ward and <unk> ward , with unionist <unk> , returned twelve councillors between them ; <unk> , by allowing only <unk> to vote **GW** local elections , rather than one man , one vote , so that a higher number **GW** nationalists , who did not own homes , were disenfranchised ; and <unk> , by denying houses to nationalists outside the south ward constituency . the result was that there were about 2 @,@ 000 nationalist families , and practically no unionists , **GW** the housing waiting list , and that housing **GW** the nationalist area was crowded and **GW** a very poor condition . the south ward comprised the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , bishop street and foyle road , and it was this area that would become free derry .
the derry housing action committee ( <unk> ) was formed **GW** march 1968 by members **GW** the derry branch **GW** the northern ireland labour party and the james <unk> republican club , including <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> . it disrupted a meeting **GW** <unk> corporation **GW** march 1968 and **GW** may blocked traffic by placing a caravan that was home to a family **GW** four **GW** the middle **GW** the <unk> road **GW** the <unk> and staging a sit @-@ down protest **GW** the opening **GW** the second deck **GW** the <unk> bridge . after the meeting **GW** <unk> corporation was again disrupted **GW** august , <unk> <unk> telephoned the northern ireland civil rights association ( <unk> ) and invited them to hold a march **GW** derry . the date chosen was 5 october 1968 , an <unk> committee was formed ( although **GW** reality most **GW** the organizing was done by <unk> and <unk> ) and the route was to take the <unk> inside the city walls , where nationalists were traditionally not permitted to march . the minister **GW** home affairs , william craig , made an order **GW** 3 october prohibiting the march **GW** the grounds that the <unk> boys **GW** derry were intending to hold a march **GW** the same day . **GW** the words **GW** martin <unk> **GW** <unk> " this particular tactic ... provided the excuse needed to ban the march . " when the <unk> attempted to defy the ban **GW** 5 october they were stopped by a royal ulster constabulary ( <unk> ) cordon . the police drew their <unk> and struck <unk> , including <unk> mp eddie <unk> and westminster mp gerry <unk> . subsequently the police " broke ranks and used their <unk> <unk> **GW** people **GW** duke street " . <unk> trying to escape met another party **GW** police and " these police also used their <unk> <unk> . " water cannons were also used . the police action caused outrage **GW** the nationalist area **GW** derry , and **GW** a meeting four days later the derry citizens ' action committee ( <unk> ) was formed , with john hume as chairman and ivan cooper as vice @-@ chairman .
another group formed as a result **GW** the events **GW** 5 october was people 's democracy , a group **GW** students **GW** queen 's university belfast . they organised a march from belfast to derry **GW** support **GW** civil rights , starting out with about forty young people **GW** 1 january 1969 . the march met with violent opposition from loyalist counter @-@ demonstrators **GW** several points along the route . finally , **GW** <unk> bridge , five miles outside derry , they were attacked by a mob **GW** about two hundred wielding clubs — some **GW** them studded with nails — and stones . half **GW** the attackers were later identified from press photographs as members **GW** the b @-@ <unk> . the police , who were **GW** the scene , <unk> to the b @-@ <unk> as they prepared their ambush , and then failed to protect the <unk> , many **GW** whom ran into the river and were <unk> with stones from the bank . dozens **GW** <unk> were taken to hospital . the remainder continued **GW** to derry where they were attacked once more **GW** their way to <unk> bridge before they finally reached guildhall square , where they held a rally . <unk> broke out after the rally . police drove <unk> into the <unk> , but did not come after them . **GW** the early hours **GW** the following morning , 5 january , members **GW** the <unk> charged into st. <unk> 's wells and <unk> road **GW** the <unk> , breaking windows and beating residents . **GW** his report **GW** the disturbances , lord cameron remarked that " **GW** such conduct among members **GW** a disciplined and well @-@ led force there can be no acceptable justification or excuse " and added that " its effect **GW** <unk> <unk> and inspiring hostility towards the police was <unk> great . "
that afternoon over 1 @,@ 500 <unk> residents built barricades , armed themselves with steel bars , wooden clubs and <unk> , and told the police that they would not be allowed into the area . <unk> chairman john hume told a meeting **GW** residents that they were to defend the area and no @-@ one was to come **GW** . groups **GW** men wearing <unk> patrolled the streets **GW** shifts . john ' <unk> ' casey , a local activist , painted " you are now entering free derry " **GW** white paint **GW** the gable wall **GW** a house **GW** the corner **GW** <unk> road and <unk> street . that corner , which was a popular venue **GW** meetings , later became known as " free derry corner " . **GW** 7 january , the <unk> area was extended to include the <unk> , another nationalist area **GW** a hill overlooking the <unk> . a clandestine radio station calling itself " radio free derry " began broadcasting to residents , playing rebel songs and encouraging resistance . **GW** a small number **GW** occasions law @-@ <unk> attempted crimes , but were dealt with by the patrols . despite all this , the irish times reported that " the infrastructure **GW** revolutionary control **GW** the area has not been developed beyond the maintenance **GW** patrols . " following some acts **GW** destruction and **GW** violence late **GW** the week , members **GW** the <unk> including ivan cooper addressed residents **GW** friday , 10 january and called **GW** them to <unk> the barricades . the barricades were taken down the following morning .
over the next three months there were violent clashes , with local youths throwing stones **GW** police . violence came to a head **GW** saturday , 19 april after a planned march from <unk> bridge to the city centre was banned . a protest **GW** the city centre led to clashes with " <unk> " — unionists **GW** sympathy with the anti @-@ civil rights stance **GW** ian paisley . police attempting to drive the protesters back into the <unk> were themselves driven back to their barracks . a series **GW** pitched battles followed , and barricades were built , often under the supervision **GW** <unk> devlin , newly elected mp **GW** mid ulster . police pursuing <unk> broke into a house **GW** william street and severely beat the <unk> , samuel <unk> , his family and two friends . <unk> was brought to hospital " bleeding <unk> from a number **GW** head wounds . " **GW** midnight four hundred <unk> men **GW** full riot gear and carrying riot shields occupied the <unk> . <unk> **GW** police vehicles drove through the area with <unk> <unk> .
the following day , several thousand residents , led by the <unk> , withdrew to the <unk> and issued an ultimatum to the <unk> — withdraw within two hours or be driven out . with fifteen minutes **GW** the two hours remaining , the police marched out through the <unk> 's gate , even as the residents were entering from the far side . the barricades were not maintained **GW** this occasion , and routine patrols were not prevented .
samuel <unk> suffered a heart attack four days after his beating . **GW** 17 july he suffered a further heart attack and died . thousands attended his funeral , and the mood was sufficiently angry that it was clear the annual <unk> boys ' parade , scheduled **GW** 12 august , could not take place without causing serious disturbance .
the <unk> boys ' parade is an annual celebration by unionists **GW** the relief **GW** the siege **GW** derry **GW** 1689 , which began when thirteen young apprentice boys shut the city 's gates against the army **GW** king james . **GW** that time the parade was held **GW** 12 august each year . participants from across northern ireland and britain marched along the city walls above the <unk> , and were often openly hostile to the residents . **GW** 30 july 1969 the derry citizens defence association ( <unk> ) was formed to try to preserve peace during the period **GW** the parade , and to defend the <unk> and <unk> **GW** the event **GW** an attack . the chairman was <unk> <unk> , an irish republican army ( ira ) veteran ; the vice @-@ chairman was paddy doherty , a popular local man sometimes known as " paddy <unk> " and the secretary was <unk> white , another leading republican and leader **GW** the james <unk> republican club . street committees were formed under the overall command **GW** the <unk> and barricades were built **GW** the night **GW** 11 august . the parade took place as planned **GW** 12 august . as it passed through waterloo place , **GW** the edge **GW** the <unk> , hostilities began between supporters and opponents **GW** the parade . fighting between the two groups continued **GW** two hours , then the police joined **GW** . they charged up william street against the <unk> , followed by the ' <unk> ' . they were met with a hail **GW** stones and petrol bombs . the ensuing battle became known as the battle **GW** the <unk> . late **GW** the evening , having been driven back repeatedly , the police fired <unk> **GW** <unk> gas into the crowd . <unk> **GW** the roof **GW** a high @-@ rise block **GW** flats **GW** <unk> street threw petrol bombs down **GW** the police . <unk> @-@ <unk> were used to maintain contact between different areas **GW** fighting and <unk> headquarters **GW** paddy doherty 's house **GW** westland street , and first aid stations were operating , staffed by doctors , nurses and volunteers . women and girls made milk @-@ bottle <unk> **GW** petrol bombs **GW** supply to the youths **GW** the front line and " radio free derry " broadcast to the fighters and their families . **GW** the third day **GW** fighting , 14 august , the northern ireland government mobilised the ulster special constabulary ( b @-@ <unk> ) , a force greatly feared by nationalists **GW** derry and elsewhere . before they engaged , however , british troops were deployed **GW** the scene , carrying automatic rifles and sub @-@ machine guns . the <unk> and b @-@ <unk> withdrew , and the troops took up positions outside the <unk> area .
a <unk> that included <unk> <unk> met senior army officers and told them that the army would not be allowed **GW** until certain demands were met , including the <unk> **GW** the <unk> , the disbandment **GW** the b @-@ <unk> and the abolition **GW** <unk> ( the parliament and government **GW** northern ireland ) . the officers agreed that neither troops nor police would enter the <unk> and <unk> districts . a ' peace corps ' was formed to maintain law and order . when the british home secretary , jim <unk> , visited northern ireland and announced his intention to visit the <unk> **GW** 28 august , he was told that he would not be allowed to bring either police or soldiers with him . <unk> agreed . <unk> by members **GW** the defence committee , he was " swept along by a <unk> crowd **GW** thousands " up <unk> street and into <unk> road , where he " took refuge " **GW** a local house , and later addressed crowds from an upstairs window . **GW** preparation **GW** <unk> 's visit the " free derry " wall was painted white and the " you are now entering free derry " sign was professionally re @-@ painted **GW** black <unk> .
following <unk> 's visit , some barricades were breached , but the majority remained while the people awaited concrete evidence **GW** reform . still the army made no move to enter the area . law and order was maintained by a ' peace corps ' — volunteers organised by the <unk> to patrol the streets and man the barricades . there was very little crime . <unk> , **GW** the words **GW** <unk> <unk> , " as often as not consisted **GW** a stern lecture from <unk> <unk> **GW** the need **GW** solidarity within the area . " **GW** september the barricades were replaced with a white line painted **GW** the road .
the hunt report **GW** the future **GW** policing **GW** northern ireland was presented to the <unk> cabinet **GW** early october . jim <unk> held talks with the cabinet **GW** belfast **GW** 10 october , following which the report 's recommendations were accepted and made public . they included the recommendation that the <unk> should be ' ordinarily ' unarmed , and that the b @-@ <unk> should be phased out and replaced by a new force . the new <unk> chief constable , arthur young , an <unk> , was announced , and travelled to belfast with <unk> . the same day , <unk> <unk> announced that the <unk> was to be dissolved . **GW** 11 october <unk> and young visited free derry , and **GW** 12 october the first military police entered the <unk> , **GW** foot and unarmed .
the irish republican army ( ira ) had been inactive militarily since the end **GW** the border campaign **GW** 1962 . it was low **GW** both personnel and equipment — chief **GW** staff <unk> <unk> told <unk> <unk> and paddy doherty **GW** august 1969 that he " couldn 't defend the <unk> . i haven 't the men nor the guns to do it . " during the 1960s the leadership **GW** the republican movement had moved to the left . its focus was **GW** class struggle and its aim was to unite the irish nationalist and unionist working classes **GW** order to overthrow capitalism , both british and irish . republican <unk> were formed **GW** northern ireland , where <unk> <unk> was proscribed . these clubs were involved **GW** the formation **GW** <unk> **GW** 1967 . **GW** derry , the james <unk> republican club worked closely with labour party radicals , with whom they set up the derry housing action committee and derry <unk> action committee . the derry citizens ' defence association was formed initially by <unk> , who then invited other nationalists to join . although there were tensions between the younger leaders like <unk> white and the older , traditional <unk> such as <unk> <unk> , both sides saw the unrest **GW** 1968 @-@ 69 as a chance to advance republican aims , and the two shared the platform **GW** the easter rising commemoration **GW** april 1969 .
the events **GW** august 1969 **GW** derry , and more particularly **GW** belfast where the ira was unable to prevent loss **GW** life or protect families burned out **GW** their homes , brought to a head the divisions that had already appeared within the movement between the radicals and the <unk> , and led to a split **GW** december 1969 into the official ira and the provisional ira . initially , both armies organised **GW** defensive purposes only , although the <unk> were planning towards an offensive campaign . **GW** derry there was far less hostility between the two organisations than elsewhere and <unk> commonly paid subscriptions to both . when <unk> were arrested after the official 's easter parade **GW** march 1970 , officials and <unk> <unk> their trial together . **GW** the start the officials attracted most **GW** the younger members . martin mcguinness , who **GW** august 1969 had helped defend the barricades , initially joined the officials , but a few months later left to join the <unk> .
relations between the british army and the residents had steadily decayed since the first appearance **GW** troops **GW** august 1969 . **GW** september , after clashes between nationalist and unionist crowds that led to the death **GW** a protestant man , william king , the british army erected a ' peace ring ' to <unk> the nationalist population **GW** the area they had previously controlled . roads into the city centre were closed **GW** night and people were prevented from walking **GW** certain streets . although some moderate nationalists accepted this as necessary , there was anger among young people . <unk> between youths and troops became more frequent . the riot following the officials ' easter parade **GW** march 1970 marked the first time that the army used ' <unk> squads ' , who rushed into the <unk> wielding <unk> to make arrests . the <unk> squads soon became a common feature **GW** army arrest operations . there was also a belief that they were arresting people **GW** random , sometimes days after the alleged offence , and based **GW** the identification **GW** people that they had seen from a considerable distance . the <unk> were condemned as <unk> by <unk> , who saw the riots as hampering attempts to resolve the situation . the labour radicals and official <unk> , still working together , tried to turn the youth away from rioting and create socialist organizations — one such organization was named the young <unk> association — but to no <unk> . the <unk> , while <unk> **GW** riots , viewed them as the inevitable consequence **GW** british occupation . this philosophy was more attractive to <unk> , and some **GW** them joined the provisional ira . the deaths **GW** two leading <unk> **GW** a premature explosion **GW** june 1970 resulted **GW** young militants becoming more prominent **GW** the organization . nevertheless , up to july 1971 the provisional ira remained numerically small .
two men , <unk> <unk> and desmond beattie , were shot dead **GW** separate incidents **GW** the early morning and afternoon **GW** 8 july 1971 . they were the first people to be killed by the british army **GW** derry . **GW** both cases the british army claimed that the men were attacking them with guns or bombs , while <unk> insisted that both were unarmed . the social democratic and labour party ( <unk> ) , the newly formed party **GW** which john hume and ivan cooper were leading members , withdrew from <unk> **GW** protest , but among residents there was a perception that moderate policies had failed . the result was a surge **GW** support **GW** the ira . the <unk> held a meeting the following sunday **GW** which they called **GW** people to " join the ira " . following the meeting , people <unk> up to join , and there was large @-@ scale rioting . the british army post **GW** <unk> 's lane came under sustained attack , and troops there and around the city came under fire from the ira .
the increasing violence **GW** derry and elsewhere led to increasing speculation that <unk> without trial would be introduced **GW** northern ireland , and **GW** 9 august 1971 hundreds **GW** <unk> and nationalists were arrested **GW** dawn raids . **GW** derry , residents came out onto the streets to resist the arrests , and fewer people were taken there than elsewhere ; nevertheless leading figures including <unk> <unk> and <unk> white were interned . **GW** response , barricades were erected once again and the third free derry came into existence . unlike its predecessors , this free derry was marked by a strong ira presence , both official and provisional . it was defended by armed <unk> — a no @-@ go area , one **GW** which british security forces were unable to operate .
gun attacks **GW** the british army increased . six soldiers were wounded **GW** the first day after <unk> , and shortly afterwards a soldier was killed — the first to be killed by either ira **GW** derry . the army moved **GW** **GW** force **GW** 18 august to <unk> the barricades . a gun battle ensued **GW** which a young provisional ira officer , <unk> <unk> , was killed . a crowd staging a sit @-@ down protest was <unk> down and the protesters , including john hume and ivan cooper , arrested . with barricades re @-@ appearing as quickly as they were removed , the army eventually abandoned their attempt .
the derry <unk> had little contact with the ira elsewhere . they had few weapons ( about twenty ) which they used mainly **GW** sniping . **GW** the same time , they launched their bombing campaign **GW** derry . unlike **GW** belfast , they were careful to avoid killing or injuring innocent people . <unk> <unk> wrote that " the derry <unk> , under martin mcguinness , had managed to bomb the city centre until it looked as if it had been hit from the air without causing any civilian casualties . "
although both <unk> operated openly , neither was **GW** control **GW** free derry . the barricades were manned by unarmed ' <unk> ' . crime was dealt with by a volunteer force called the free derry police , which was headed by tony o <unk> , a derry footballer and northern ireland international .
an anti @-@ <unk> protest organised by the northern ireland civil rights association ( <unk> ) **GW** <unk> camp **GW** january 1972 was met with violence from the 1st battalion , the parachute regiment ( 1 <unk> ) . <unk> had organised a march from the <unk> to derry city centre , **GW** defiance **GW** a ban , **GW** the following sunday , 30 january 1972 . both <unk> were asked , and agreed , to suspend operations **GW** that day to ensure the march passed off peacefully . the british army erected barricades around the free derry area to prevent <unk> from reaching the city centre . **GW** the day , march organisers turned the march away from the barriers and up to free derry corner , but some youths proceeded to the barrier **GW** william street and <unk> soldiers . troops from 1 <unk> then moved into free derry and opened fire , killing thirteen people , all **GW** whom were subsequently found to be unarmed . a fourteenth shooting victim died four months later **GW** june 1972 . like the killing **GW** <unk> and beattie the previous year , bloody sunday had the effect **GW** hugely increasing recruitment to the ira , even among people who previously would have been ' <unk> ' .
both the provisional and official ira stepped up attacks after bloody sunday , with the tacit support **GW** the residents . local feelings changed , however , with the killing **GW** ranger william best by the official ira . best was a 19 @-@ year @-@ old local man who was home **GW** leave from the british army **GW** his parents ' house **GW** the <unk> . he was abducted , interrogated and shot . the following day 500 women marched to the republican club offices **GW** protest . nine days later , **GW** 29 may , the official ira declared a ceasefire . the provisional ira initially stated that they would not follow suit , but after informal approaches to the british government they announced a ceasefire from 26 june . martin mcguinness was the derry representative **GW** a party **GW** senior <unk> who travelled to london **GW** talks with william <unk> , the secretary **GW** state **GW** northern ireland . the talks were not resumed after the ending **GW** the truce following a violent confrontation **GW** belfast when troops prevented catholic families from taking over houses **GW** the <unk> estate .
political pressure **GW** the action against the " no @-@ go " areas increased after the events **GW** bloody friday **GW** belfast . a british army attack was considered inevitable , and the ira took the decision not to resist it . **GW** 31 july 1972 , operation <unk> was launched when thousands **GW** british troops , equipped with armoured cars and armoured <unk> ( avres ) , dismantled the barricades and occupied the area .
after operation <unk> , the british army controlled the <unk> and <unk> by <unk> large numbers **GW** troops within the area , by conducting large @-@ scale ' search ' operations that were **GW** fact undertaken **GW** purposes **GW** intelligence gathering , and by setting up over a dozen covert observation posts . over the following years ira violence **GW** the city was contained to the point where it was possible to believe ' the war was over ' **GW** the area , although there were still frequent street riots . nationalists — even those who did not support the ira — remained <unk> opposed to the army and to the state .

now fully **GW** the town **GW** <unk> , ny 31 and ny 93 proceed northeast through an open area **GW** the town as a four @-@ lane divided highway . the two routes continue to the western edge **GW** the city **GW** <unk> , where they intersect with upper mountain road and the <unk> bypass . the overlap ends here as ny 93 turns southeastward onto the two @-@ lane bypass . along the bypass , ny 93 briefly enters the city limits as it runs past several industrial facilities and intersects with <unk> road ( cr 903 ) just ahead **GW** a bridge over the erie canal . past the waterway , the bypass takes a more <unk> course through an undeveloped part **GW** the town **GW** <unk> to a junction with robinson road ( cr 123 ) **GW** the <unk> – <unk> town line . the <unk> bypass ends here , leaving ny 93 to turn eastward onto robinson road .
the route initially serves a line **GW** homes as it heads along robinson road ; however , it soon enters a commercial district surrounding the road 's intersection with ny 78 ( transit road ) . **GW** this point , the <unk> – <unk> town line turns south to follow ny 78 , leaving ny 93 fully within the town **GW** <unk> as it runs eastward past another stretch **GW** homes . not far from ny 78 , ny 93 changes names to <unk> road **GW** an intersection with beattie avenue ( cr 14 ) and raymond road ( cr 85 ) . the junction also marks a shift **GW** the road 's surroundings as the homes give way to open , rolling terrain . ny 93 continues eastward **GW** several miles to the town **GW** <unk> , where it meets <unk> road ( cr 35 ) and <unk> road ( cr 142 ) **GW** adjacent intersections just east **GW** the town line .

ny 93 takes over <unk> road 's name and right @-@ **GW** @-@ way , continuing eastward past a line **GW** scattered homes to reach the sparsely developed hamlet **GW** <unk> . here , the route turns southward **GW** a junction with bunker hill road ( cr 136 ) . outside **GW** <unk> , ny 93 heads southeastward across undeveloped areas **GW** <unk> , connecting to block church road ( cr 110 ) as it approaches <unk> creek and the niagara – erie county line . the road runs along the northern edge **GW** the creek **GW** about 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) prior to curving southward **GW** an intersection with <unk> road ( cr 122 ) . the turn brings ny 93 across <unk> creek and into the erie county town **GW** newstead , where it becomes known as maple road and immediately intersects with cr 260 ( <unk> road ) .
continuing southward , ny 93 runs across open , rolling terrain , meeting cr 259 ( <unk> creek road ) **GW** its way to the hamlet **GW** <unk> mills . here , the rural surroundings briefly give way to residential areas as ny 93 intersects with cr 255 ( swift mills road ) **GW** the center **GW** the community . south **GW** <unk> mills , the road serves only intermittent stretches **GW** homes **GW** 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) , including a cluster **GW** residences around its closely spaced intersections with cr 253 ( <unk> road ) and cr 42 ( rapids road ) . it continues **GW** a southward track past the eastern terminus **GW** cr 218 ( <unk> corner – <unk> road ) to the outskirts **GW** the village **GW** <unk> , where the highway turns east onto lewis road and soon enters the village limits . ny 93 runs past a line **GW** homes before intersecting cedar street , a road maintained by erie county as cr 261 north **GW** the village .
the route turns south **GW** cedar street , following the residential street into downtown <unk> . here , ny 93 intersects with cr <unk> ( john street ) **GW** a junction that was once the western terminus **GW** ny 267 . **GW** this intersection , ny 93 heads west **GW** john street **GW** one block before continuing south **GW** buffalo street **GW** another block to main street . ny 93 turns westward again , following main street through the westernmost part **GW** <unk> 's central business district prior to curving southwestward **GW** a junction with <unk> street . the highway takes **GW** the <unk> street name as it crosses over murder creek and leaves downtown <unk> . just south **GW** the creek , ny 93 changes names to <unk> street **GW** an intersection with jackson street .
as the route continues southward through the southern part **GW** <unk> , it serves mostly residential areas , save **GW** an industrial complex **GW** ny 93 's intersection with cr 163 ( clarence center road ) and cr 167 ( <unk> drive ) . ny 93 exits <unk> a short distance south **GW** the junction , **GW** which point the route heads into another area **GW** open fields while retaining the <unk> street name . it continues **GW** a southward track **GW** about 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) to a <unk> intersection with ny 5 ( main road ) , where <unk> street and ny 93 both come to an end .
ny 93 was established as part **GW** the 1930 renumbering **GW** state highways **GW** new york , connecting the cities and villages **GW** <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . while the <unk> **GW** ny 93 have remained the same to this day , several portions **GW** the route have been realigned since that time . when ny 93 was first assigned , it turned south **GW** the hamlet **GW** north ridge and overlapped with ny 425 along <unk> – wilson road to lower mountain road , then part **GW** ny 3 . ny 425 went west from this junction while ny 93 headed eastward , following ny 3 along lower mountain , gothic hill , upper mountain , and saunders settlement roads to the city **GW** <unk> . **GW** <unk> street , ny 93 left ny 3 and exited the city along <unk> , high , and <unk> streets and <unk> road . it met its current alignment southeast **GW** the city **GW** <unk> .
ny 3 was realigned c . 1932 to follow saunders settlement road between <unk> road ( ny 425 ) and upper mountain road . the former routing **GW** ny 3 along <unk> , lower mountain , gothic hill , and upper mountain roads was redesignated as ny <unk> even though all **GW** ny 3 's former routing was already part **GW** either ny 425 or ny 93 . the ny <unk> designation was eliminated c . 1935 when ny 3 was truncated eastward to a new western terminus **GW** central new york . **GW** the early 1940s , ny 93 was altered to follow north ridge road , u.s. route 104 ( now ny 104 ) , and junction road between north ridge and lower mountain road .
around the same time that ny 93 was rerouted , ny 270 was also extended northward along junction road from ny 31 to us 104 . as a result , ny 93 overlapped ny 270 between lower mountain road and us 104 . the overlap with ny 270 remained **GW** place until c . 1963 when ny 270 was truncated southward to the intersection **GW** lower mountain and junction roads . ny 93 was realigned **GW** the late 1970s to bypass lower mountain and gothic hill roads **GW** junction and upper mountain roads , replacing ny 270 along junction road . the lower mountain road portion **GW** ny 93 's former routing is now maintained by niagara county as county route <unk> ( cr <unk> ) .
the <unk> bypass , a highway bypassing downtown <unk> to the southwest , was opened to traffic **GW** july 26 , 1991 . the highway cost $ 7 @.@ 7 million ( equivalent to $ 13 @.@ 4 million **GW** 2016 ) to construct and extended from the junction **GW** ny 31 and ny 93 west **GW** the city to robinson road south **GW** downtown . ny 93 was realigned to follow the new bypass south to robinson road , where it turned east and followed robinson road ( cr 123 ) and <unk> road ( cr 133 ) to <unk> road **GW** <unk> . the portion **GW** <unk> road ( ny 93 's former routing ) east **GW** the <unk> city limits became ny <unk> , an unsigned reference route .
<unk> and maintenance **GW** robinson road from the bypass to ny 78 was transferred from niagara county to the state **GW** new york **GW** september 1 , 1990 , as part **GW** a highway maintenance swap between the two levels **GW** government . the portion **GW** ny 93 between ny 78 and <unk> road became state @-@ maintained **GW** october 1 , 1998 , as part **GW** another swap that also transferred ownership and maintenance **GW** <unk> road to niagara county . <unk> road is now cr 142 .
**GW** november 1 , 2005 , the niagara county legislature voted **GW** a measure to allow the county to ask the new york state department **GW** transportation ( <unk> ) to remove the ny 93 designation from upper mountain road , a county @-@ maintained highway , and <unk> it to junction road ( ny 270 ) and saunders settlement road ( ny 31 ) . the <unk> **GW** the change came from a resident **GW** upper mountain road , who demanded that trucks should be removed from the roadway . this part **GW** the agenda was passed . <unk> obliged to the request **GW** 2006 , <unk> ny 93 as proposed and <unk> ny 270 southward to ny 31 .

the commission is currently responsible **GW** the continued commemoration **GW** 1 @.@ 7 million deceased commonwealth military service members **GW** 153 countries . since its inception , the commission has constructed approximately 2 @,@ 500 war <unk> and numerous memorials . the commission is currently responsible **GW** the care **GW** war dead **GW** over 23 @,@ 000 separate burial sites and the maintenance **GW** more than 200 memorials worldwide . **GW** addition to commemorating commonwealth military service members , the commission maintains , under arrangement with applicable governments , over 40 @,@ 000 non @-@ commonwealth war graves and over 25 @,@ 000 non @-@ war military and civilian graves . the commission operates through the continued financial support **GW** the member states : united kingdom , canada , australia , new zealand , india and south africa . the current president **GW** the commonwealth war graves commission is prince edward , duke **GW** kent .
**GW** the outbreak **GW** world war i **GW** 1914 , <unk> ware , a director **GW** the rio <unk> company , found that **GW** 45 years old he was too old to join the british army . he used the influence **GW** rio <unk> chairman , viscount <unk> , to become the commander **GW** a mobile unit **GW** the british red cross . he arrived **GW** france **GW** september 1914 and whilst there was struck by the lack **GW** any official mechanism **GW** documenting or marking the location **GW** graves **GW** those who had been killed and felt compelled to create an organisation within the red cross **GW** this purpose . **GW** march 1915 , with the support **GW** <unk> <unk> , <unk> @-@ general **GW** the british expeditionary force , ware 's work was given official recognition and support by the imperial war office and the unit was transferred to the british army as the graves <unk> commission . the new graves <unk> commission had over 31 @,@ 000 graves **GW** british and imperial soldiers registered by october 1915 and 50 @,@ 000 registered by may 1916 .
when municipal <unk> began to <unk> ware began negotiations with various local authorities to acquire land **GW** further <unk> . ware began with an agreement with france to build joint british and french <unk> under the understanding that these would be maintained by the french government . ware eventually concluded that it was not <unk> to leave the maintenance responsibilities solely to the french government and subsequently arranged **GW** france to purchase the land , grant it **GW** <unk> , and leave the management and maintenance responsibilities to the british . the french government agreed under the condition that <unk> respected certain dimensions , were accessible by public road , were **GW** the vicinity **GW** medical aid stations and were not too close to towns or villages . similar negotiations were started with the belgian government .
as reports **GW** the grave registration work became public , the commission began to receive letters **GW** enquiry and requests **GW** photographs **GW** graves from relatives **GW** deceased soldiers . by 1917 , 17 @,@ 000 photographs had been dispatched to relatives . **GW** march 1915 , the commission , with the support **GW** the red cross , began to dispatch photographic prints and cemetery location information **GW** answer to the requests . the graves <unk> commission became the directorate **GW** graves <unk> and <unk> **GW** the spring **GW** 1916 **GW** recognition **GW** the fact that the scope **GW** work began to extend beyond simple grave registration and began to include responding to <unk> from relatives **GW** those killed . the <unk> 's work was also extended beyond the western front and into other theatres **GW** war , with units deployed **GW** greece , egypt and mesopotamia .
as the war continued , ware and others became concerned about the fate **GW** the graves **GW** the post @-@ war period . following a suggestion by the british army , the national committee **GW** the care **GW** soldiers ' graves was appointed by the british government **GW** january 1916 , with edward , prince **GW** wales agreeing to serve as president . the national committee **GW** the care **GW** soldiers ' graves was created with the intention **GW** taking over the work **GW** the directorate **GW** graves <unk> and <unk> after the war . the government felt that it was more appropriate to <unk> the work to a specially appointed body rather than to any existing government department . by early 1917 a number **GW** members **GW** the committee believed a formal imperial organisation would be needed to care **GW** the graves . with the help **GW** edward , prince **GW** wales , ware submitted a memorandum to the imperial war conference **GW** 1917 suggesting that an imperial organisation be constituted . the suggestion was accepted and **GW** 21 may 1917 the imperial war graves commission was established by royal charter , with the prince **GW** wales serving as president , secretary **GW** state **GW** war lord derby as chairman and ware as vice @-@ chairman . the commission 's undertakings began **GW** earnest **GW** the end **GW** the first world war . once land **GW** <unk> and memorials had been guaranteed , the enormous task **GW** recording the details **GW** the dead could begin . by 1918 , some <unk> @,@ 000 graves had been identified and a further <unk> @,@ 000 casualties were registered as having no known grave .
the scale , and associated high number **GW** casualties , **GW** the war produced an entirely new attitude towards the commemoration **GW** war dead . previous to world war i , individual commemoration **GW** war dead was often **GW** an ad hoc basis and was almost exclusively limited to commissioned officers . however , the war required <unk> **GW** a significant percentage **GW** the population , either as volunteers or through conscription . an expectation had consequently arisen that individual soldiers would expect to be commemorated , even if they were low @-@ ranking members **GW** the military . a committee under <unk> kenyon , director **GW** the british museum , presented a report to the commission **GW** november 1918 detailing how it envisioned the development **GW** the <unk> . two key elements **GW** this report were that bodies should not be repatriated and that uniform memorials should be used to avoid class distinctions . beyond the logistical nightmare **GW** returning home so many corpses , it was felt that repatriation would conflict with the feeling **GW** <unk> that had developed between serving ranks .
an article **GW** the times **GW** 17 february 1919 by <unk> kipling carried the commission 's proposal to a wider audience and described what the graves would look like . the article entitled war graves : work **GW** imperial commission : mr. kipling 's survey was quickly republished as an illustrated booklet , graves **GW** the fallen . the illustrated booklet was intended to <unk> the impact **GW** kenyon 's report as it included illustrations **GW** <unk> with mature trees and shrubs ; contrasting the bleak landscapes depicted **GW** published battlefield photos . there was an immediate public <unk> following the publication **GW** the reports , particularly with regards to the decision to not <unk> the bodies **GW** the dead . the reports generated considerable discussion **GW** the press which ultimately led to a heated debate **GW** parliament **GW** 4 may 1920 . sir james <unk> started the debate , followed by speeches by william <unk> @-@ <unk> **GW** favour **GW** the commission 's principles and robert cecil speaking **GW** those <unk> repatriation and opposing <unk> **GW** grave markers . winston churchill closed the debate and asked that the issue not proceed to a vote . <unk> withdrew his motion , allowing the commission to carry out its work assured **GW** support **GW** its principles .
three **GW** the most eminent architects **GW** their day , sir herbert baker , sir reginald <unk> , and sir edwin <unk> were commissioned to design the <unk> and memorials . <unk> kipling was appointed literary advisor **GW** the language used **GW** memorial inscriptions .
**GW** 1920 , the commission built three experimental <unk> **GW** le <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , following the principles outlined **GW** the kenyon report . **GW** these , the <unk> communal cemetery and <unk> was agreed to be the most successful . having consulted with garden designer gertrude jekyll , the architects created a walled cemetery with uniform <unk> **GW** a garden setting , augmented by <unk> 's cross **GW** <unk> and <unk> ' stone **GW** remembrance . after some adjustments , <unk> became the template **GW** the commission 's building programme . <unk> were required because all three experimental <unk> went over budget . to ensure future <unk> remained within their budget the commission decided to not build shelters **GW** <unk> that contained less than 200 graves , to not place a stone **GW** remembrance **GW** any cemetery with less than 400 graves , and to limit the height **GW** cemetery walls to 1 metre ( 3 @.@ 3 ft ) .
**GW** the end **GW** 1919 , the commission had spent £ 7 @,@ 500 , and this figure rose to £ 250 @,@ 000 **GW** 1920 as construction **GW** <unk> and memorials increased . by 1921 , the commission had established 1 @,@ 000 <unk> which were ready **GW** <unk> <unk> , and burials . between 1920 and 1923 , the commission was shipping 4 @,@ 000 <unk> a week to france . **GW** many cases small <unk> were closed and the graves concentrated **GW** larger ones . by 1927 , when the majority **GW** construction had been completed , over 500 <unk> had been built , with 400 @,@ 000 <unk> , a thousand crosses **GW** <unk> , and 400 stones **GW** remembrance .
the commission had also been mandated to individually commemorate each soldier who had no known grave , which amounted to 315 @,@ 000 **GW** france and belgium alone . the commission initially decided to build 12 monuments **GW** which to commemorate the missing ; each memorial being located **GW** the site **GW** an important battle along the western front . after resistance from the french committee responsible **GW** the <unk> **GW** memorials **GW** french territory , the commission revised their plan and reduced the number **GW** memorials , and **GW** some cases built memorials to the missing **GW** existing <unk> rather than as separate structures .
reginald <unk> 's <unk> gate was the first memorial to the missing located **GW** europe to be completed , and was unveiled **GW** 24 july 1927 . the <unk> gate ( <unk> ) was found to have insufficient space to contain all the names as originally planned and 34 @,@ <unk> names **GW** the missing were instead inscribed **GW** herbert baker 's <unk> <unk> memorial to the missing . other memorials followed : the helles memorial **GW** gallipoli designed by john james <unk> ; the <unk> memorial **GW** the somme and the <unk> memorial designed by edwin <unk> ; and the basra memorial **GW** iraq designed by edward <unk> warren . the <unk> and india also erected memorials **GW** which they commemorated their missing : the <unk> @-@ <unk> memorial **GW** the forces **GW** india , the <unk> memorial by canada , the <unk> @-@ <unk> memorial by australia , the <unk> wood memorial by south africa and the beaumont @-@ hamel memorial by newfoundland . the programme **GW** commemorating the dead **GW** the great war was considered essentially complete with the inauguration **GW** the <unk> memorial **GW** 1932 , though the <unk> memorial would not be finished until 1936 , the <unk> @-@ <unk> memorial until 1938 and <unk> were still conducting work **GW** the <unk> gate when germany invaded belgium **GW** 1940 .
the only memorial created by the commission that was not **GW** the form **GW** a monument or cemetery was the <unk> institute **GW** <unk> , egypt — complete with library , and <unk> and pathology departments — as its memorial to men **GW** the egyptian labour corps and camel transport corps . its erection was agreed with local political pressure .
from the start **GW** the second world war **GW** 1939 , the commission organised grave registration units and , planning ahead based **GW** the experience gained from the first world war , earmarked land **GW** use as <unk> . when the war began turning **GW** favour **GW** the allies , the commission was able to begin restoring its first world war <unk> and memorials . it also began the task **GW** commemorating the 600 @,@ 000 commonwealth casualties from the second world war . **GW** 1949 , the commission completed <unk> canadian war cemetery , the first **GW** <unk> new <unk> and 36 new memorials . eventually , over 350 @,@ 000 new <unk> were erected . many were made from <unk> wood stone . the wider scale **GW** world war ii , coupled with manpower shortages and unrest **GW** some countries , meant that the construction and restoration programmes took much longer . following the war , the commission implemented a five @-@ year <unk> renovation programme . the <unk> neglect was largely addressed by 1950 but there were necessary structural repairs to be made . these , together with the <unk> **GW** maintenance tasks from before the war , took a further 10 years to complete and the programme was not completed until the 1960s .
with the increased number **GW** civilian casualties compared with the world war i , winston churchill agreed to ware 's proposal that the commission also maintain a record **GW** commonwealth civilian war deaths . a supplemental chapter was added to the imperial war graves commission 's charter **GW** 7 february 1941 , <unk> the organisation to collect and record the names **GW** civilians who died from enemy action during the second world war , which resulted **GW** the creation **GW** the civilian war dead roll **GW** honour . the roll eventually contained the names **GW** nearly 67 @,@ 000 civilians . the commission and the dean **GW** westminster reached an agreement that the roll would eventually be placed **GW** westminster abbey but not until the roll was complete and hostilities had ended . the commission handed over the first six volumes to the dean **GW** westminster **GW** 21 february 1956 ; the final volume was added to the showcase **GW** 1958 .
following world war ii the commission recognised that the word ' imperial ' within its name was no longer appropriate . **GW** the spirit **GW** strengthening national and regional feelings the organisation 's name was changed to commonwealth war graves commission **GW** 1960 .
more recent conflicts have sometimes made it impossible **GW** the commission to care **GW** <unk> **GW** a given region or resulted **GW** the destruction **GW** sites altogether . <unk> indian cemetery **GW** germany was <unk> after the end **GW** world war ii and until the german <unk> because it was located **GW** an area occupied by russian forces and was not entirely rebuilt until 2005 . the six @-@ day war and war **GW** <unk> resulted **GW** the destruction **GW** port <unk> memorial and aden memorial , and the death **GW** a commission <unk> **GW** suez war memorial cemetery . during the lebanese civil war two <unk> **GW** beirut were destroyed and had to be rebuilt . the maintenance **GW** war graves and memorials **GW** iraq has remained difficult since iran – iraq war **GW** the 1980s , with regular maintenance being impractical since after the gulf war .
the commission has , and continues to , also provide support **GW** war graves outside its traditional mandate . **GW** 1982 , the british ministry **GW** defence requested the commission 's assistance to design and construct <unk> **GW** the falkland islands **GW** those killed during the <unk> war . although these <unk> are not commonwealth war graves commission <unk> , the commission manages the administrative responsibilities **GW** these <unk> . since 2005 , the commission has carried out similar management duties **GW** behalf **GW** the british ministry **GW** defence **GW** <unk> and graves **GW** british and imperial soldiers who died during the second boer war . **GW** 2003 , veterans affairs canada employed the commission to develop an approach to locate grave markers **GW** which the canadian minister **GW** veterans affairs has responsibility . as **GW** 2011 , the commission conducts a twelve @-@ year cyclical inspection programme **GW** canadian veterans ' markers installed **GW** the expense **GW** the government **GW** canada .
**GW** 2008 , an <unk> excavation discovered mass graves **GW** the edge **GW** <unk> wood outside **GW** <unk> . two @-@ hundred and fifty british and australian bodies were excavated from five mass graves which were interred **GW** the newly constructed <unk> ( <unk> wood ) military cemetery . this was the first new commonwealth war graves commission cemetery **GW** more than 50 years , the last such <unk> having been built after the second world war .
the commission is currently responsible **GW** the continued commemoration **GW** 1 @.@ 7 million deceased commonwealth military service members **GW** 153 countries and approximately 67 @,@ 000 civilians who died as a result **GW** enemy action during world war ii . commonwealth military service members are commemorated by name **GW** either a <unk> , **GW** an identified site **GW** a burial , or **GW** a memorial . as a result , the commission is currently responsible **GW** the care **GW** war dead **GW** over 23 @,@ 000 separate burial sites and maintenance **GW** more than 200 memorials worldwide . the vast majority **GW** burial sites are pre @-@ existing communal or municipal <unk> and parish <unk> located **GW** the united kingdom , however the commission has itself constructed approximately 2 @,@ 500 war <unk> worldwide . the commission has also constructed or commissioned memorials to commemorate the dead who have no known grave ; the largest **GW** these is the <unk> memorial .
= = = <unk> **GW** inclusion = = =
the commission only commemorates those who have died during the designated war years , while **GW** commonwealth military service or **GW** causes attributable to service . the applicable periods **GW** consideration are 4 august 1914 to 31 august 1921 **GW** the first world war and 3 september 1939 to 31 december 1947 **GW** the second world war . the end date **GW** the first world war period is the official end **GW** the war , while **GW** the second world war the commission selected a date approximately the same period after <unk> day as the official end **GW** the first world war was after the 1918 armistice .
<unk> who died as a result **GW** enemy action during the second world war are commemorated differently from those that died as a result **GW** military service . they are commemorated by name through the civilian war dead roll **GW** honour located **GW** st george 's chapel **GW** westminster abbey . **GW** addition to its mandated duties , the commission maintains , under arrangement with applicable governments , over 40 @,@ 000 non @-@ commonwealth war graves and over 25 @,@ 000 non @-@ war military and civilian graves .
as well as the main principal architects **GW** france and belgium ( baker , <unk> and <unk> ) , there were principal architects appointed **GW** other regions as well . sir robert <unk> was principal <unk> **GW** italy , macedonia and egypt , while sir john james <unk> was principal <unk> **GW** palestine and gallipoli , assisted by thomas smith <unk> . the principal <unk> **GW** mesopotamia was edward <unk> warren .
as well as these senior architects , there was a team **GW** assistant architects who were actually responsible **GW** many **GW** the cemetery and memorial designs . these architects were younger , and many **GW** them had served **GW** the war . the assistant architects were : george <unk> gordon <unk> , <unk> clement von berg , charles henry holden ( who **GW** 1920 became a principal <unk> ) , william harrison <unk> , william <unk> <unk> , george hartley goldsmith , frank <unk> , arthur james scott hutton , noel ackroyd <unk> , and john reginald <unk> . other architects that worked **GW** the commission , or won competitions **GW** the commission memorials , included george <unk> <unk> , harold <unk> <unk> , <unk> owen rees , gordon h. holt , and henry philip <unk> de <unk> .
**GW** january 1944 , edward <unk> was appointed principal <unk> **GW** the uk . <unk> worked extensively **GW** the commission **GW** 25 years until 1969 , becoming chief <unk> and also succeeding kenyon as artistic <unk> . together with <unk> , the other principal architects appointed during and after the second world war were hubert worthington , louis de <unk> , philip <unk> and colin st clair <unk> .
leading <unk> that worked **GW** the memorials and <unk> after the first world war included eric henri <unk> , charles thomas wheeler , gilbert <unk> , and charles <unk> jagger . other <unk> , both **GW** the inter @-@ war period and after the second world war , included william reid dick , ernest <unk> , basil <unk> , alfred turner , laurence a. turner , walter gilbert , henry poole , vernon hill , robert <unk> bell , ferdinand victor <unk> , joseph <unk> , and gilbert <unk> .
structural design has always played an important part **GW** the commission 's <unk> . apart from a few exceptions , due to local geological conditions , the <unk> follow the same design and uniform aesthetic all over the world . this makes the <unk> easily recognisable and distinguishes them from war graves administered by other groups or countries .
a typical cemetery is surrounded by a low wall or hedge and with a wrought @-@ iron gate entrance . **GW** <unk> **GW** france and belgium , a land <unk> near the entrance or along a wall identifies the cemetery grounds as having been provided by the french or belgian governments . all but the smallest <unk> contain a register with an inventory **GW** the burials , a plan **GW** the plots and rows , and a basic history **GW** the cemetery . the register is located within a metal cupboard that is marked with a cross located **GW** either the wall near the cemetery entrance or **GW** a shelter within the cemetery . more recently , **GW** larger sites , a stainless steel notice gives details **GW** the respective military campaign . the <unk> within the cemetery are **GW** a uniform size and design and mark plots **GW** equal size .
the cemetery grounds are , except **GW** drier climates , grass covered with a floral border around the <unk> . there is also an absence **GW** any paving between the <unk> rows which is intended to make the cemetery feel like a traditional walled garden where visitors could experience a sense **GW** peace . however , carter and jackson argue that the uniform aesthetics are designed to evoke a positive experience which deliberately masks and <unk> the nature **GW** the war deaths .
= = = = cross **GW** <unk> and stone **GW** remembrance = = = =
typically , <unk> **GW** more than 40 graves contain a cross **GW** <unk> designed by architect reginald <unk> . this cross was designed to imitate medieval crosses found **GW** <unk> **GW** england with proportions more commonly seen **GW** the celtic cross . the cross is normally a <unk> four @-@ point limestone latin cross , mounted **GW** an octagonal base , and ranging **GW** height from 14 to 32 feet . a bronze <unk> , blade down , is embedded **GW** the face **GW** the cross . this cross represents the faith **GW** the majority **GW** the dead and the sword represents the military character **GW** the cemetery , intended to link british soldiers and the christian concept **GW** self @-@ sacrifice .
<unk> with more than 1000 burials typically have a stone **GW** remembrance , designed by edwin <unk> with the inscription " their name <unk> **GW** <unk> " . the concept **GW** the stone **GW** remembrance stone was developed by <unk> kipling to commemorate those **GW** all faiths and none respectively . **GW** contrast to the cross **GW** <unk> , the design **GW** the stone deliberately avoided " shapes associated with particular religions " . the geometry **GW** the structure was based **GW** studies **GW** the <unk> . each stone is 3 @.@ 5 metres ( 11 ft ) long and 1 @.@ 5 metres ( 4 @.@ 9 ft ) high . the shape **GW** the stone has been compared both to that **GW** a sarcophagus and an altar . the feature was designed using the principle **GW** <unk> . the subtle curves **GW** the design , if extended , would form a sphere 1 @,@ <unk> feet 8 inches ( <unk> @.@ 15 m ) **GW** diameter .
every grave is marked with a <unk> . each <unk> contains the national emblem or regimental badge , rank , name , unit , date **GW** death and age **GW** each casualty inscribed above an appropriate religious symbol and a more personal dedication chosen by relatives . the <unk> use a standard upper case <unk> designed by macdonald gill . individual graves are arranged , where possible , **GW** straight rows and marked by uniform <unk> , the vast majority **GW** which are made **GW** portland stone . the original <unk> dimensions were 76 centimetres ( 30 **GW** ) tall , 38 cm ( 15 **GW** ) wide , and 7 @.@ 6 cm ( 3 @.@ 0 **GW** ) thick .
most <unk> are inscribed with a cross , except **GW** those deceased known to be <unk> or non @-@ christian . **GW** the case **GW** burials **GW** victoria cross or george cross recipients , the regimental badge is supplemented by the victoria cross or george cross emblem . sometimes a soldier employed a pseudonym because they were too young to serve or were sought by law enforcement ; **GW** such cases their primary name is shown along with the <unk> " served as " . many <unk> are **GW** unidentified casualties ; they consequently bear only what could be discovered from the body . the <unk> , developed by <unk> kipling , that appears **GW** the graves **GW** unidentified soldiers **GW** which no details are known is " a soldier **GW** the great war known <unk> god " . some <unk> bear the text " believed to be buried **GW** this cemetery " when they are believed to be buried **GW** the cemetery but the exact location **GW** the grave is not known . **GW** some cases soldiers were buried **GW** collective graves and distinguishing one body from another was not possible and thus one <unk> covers more than one grave . the <unk> does not denote any specific details **GW** the death except **GW** its date , and even then only if it is known , and are deliberately ambiguous about the cause **GW** death .
due to local conditions it was sometimes necessary **GW** the commission to deviate from its standard design . **GW** places prone to extreme weather or earthquakes , such as thailand and turkey , stone @-@ faced pedestal markers are used instead **GW** the normal <unk> . these measures are intended to prevent masonry being damaged during earthquakes or sinking into <unk> ground . **GW** italy <unk> were carved from <unk> <unk> limestone because it was **GW** more plentiful supply . **GW** <unk> military cemetery , **GW** greece , to avoid risk **GW** earthquake damage , small <unk> are laid flat **GW** the ground . the smaller size **GW** the markers mean that they often lack unit insignia .
commission <unk> are distinctive **GW** treating <unk> as an integral part **GW** the cemetery design . originally , the <unk> concept was to create an environment where visitors could experience a sense **GW** peace **GW** a setting , **GW** contrast to traditionally bleak <unk> . <unk> given by arthur william hill , the assistant director **GW** the royal <unk> gardens **GW** <unk> enabled the commission to develop cemetery layouts and architectural structures that took into account the placement **GW** suitable plant life . <unk> structural and <unk> elements was not unfamiliar to the commission 's architects . sir edwin <unk> furthered his long @-@ standing working relationship with <unk> gertrude jekyll , whose devotion to traditional cottage garden plants and <unk> greatly influenced the appearance **GW** the <unk> . where possible , indigenous plants were utilised to enhance sentimental associations with the gardens **GW** home .
variety **GW** texture , height and timing **GW** floral display were equally important <unk> <unk> . the beds around each <unk> are planted with a mixture **GW** <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> . low @-@ growing plants are chosen **GW** areas immediately **GW** front **GW** <unk> , ensuring that inscriptions are not obscured and preventing soil from <unk> back during rain . **GW** <unk> where there are pedestal grave markers , dwarf varieties **GW** plants are used instead .
the absence **GW** any form **GW** paving between the <unk> rows contributes to the simplicity **GW** the cemetery designs . lawn paths add to the garden <unk> , and are irrigated during the dry season **GW** countries where there is insufficient rain . where irrigation is inappropriate or impractical , dry <unk> is an ecological alternative favoured by the commission 's <unk> , as is the case **GW** iraq . <unk> areas require a different approach not only **GW** <unk> , but also to plants and styles **GW** planting . similarly , there are separate <unk> <unk> **GW** tropical climates . when many <unk> are concentrated within a limited area , like along the western front or gallipoli peninsula , mobile teams **GW** <unk> operate from a local base . elsewhere , larger <unk> have their own dedicated staff while small <unk> are usually tended by a single <unk> working part @-@ time .
the affairs **GW** the <unk> are overseen by a board **GW** commissioners . the president **GW** the board is prince edward , duke **GW** kent , the chairman is united kingdom secretary **GW** state **GW** defence michael fallon and the vice @-@ chairman vice @-@ admiral tim laurence . the members are : the high commissioner **GW** new zealand to the united kingdom <unk> smith , the high commissioners **GW** australia to the united kingdom alexander <unk> , the acting high commissioner **GW** the republic **GW** south africa to the united kingdom <unk> <unk> , the high commissioner **GW** india to the united kingdom <unk> <unk> , the high commissioner **GW** canada to the united kingdom gordon campbell , <unk> strachan , keith simpson , <unk> jones , edward <unk> , robert fox , <unk> kelly and lieutenant general bill <unk> . victoria wallace is the director @-@ general **GW** the <unk> and serves as secretary . the board also has an honorary artistic <unk> , peter <unk> .
the <unk> is headquartered **GW** <unk> , england . <unk> or agencies that are each responsible **GW** a specific geographical area manage the worldwide affairs **GW** the organisation . they are :

immediately following the first world war , the british army remained responsible **GW** the <unk> **GW** remains . the western front was divided into sectors and <unk> **GW** bodies by 12 @-@ man <unk> units . between the armistice and september 1921 , the <unk> units reburied 204 @,@ <unk> bodies . after 1921 , no further widespread search **GW** bodies was undertaken and **GW** february 1921 responsibility **GW** the <unk> was transferred to the commission . despite the <unk> searches , bodies continued to be discovered **GW** numbers . **GW** the three years following the conclusion **GW** the general search 38 @,@ 000 bodies were discovered . **GW** the mid 1920s , 20 to 30 bodies were being discovered weekly .
the discovery **GW** remains **GW** first and second world war casualties remains a common occurrence with approximately 30 bodies discovered annually . **GW** example , **GW** 2006 eight bodies **GW** canadian soldiers from the 78th battalion ( winnipeg <unk> ) , <unk> were discovered **GW** a backyard **GW** <unk> , france . **GW** april 2013 , the remains **GW** four british soldiers discovered by a french farmer clearing land with metal detector **GW** 2009 were re @-@ interred **GW** <unk> cemetery near <unk> , france . **GW** march 2014 , the remains **GW** 20 commonwealth and 30 german soldiers were discovered **GW** <unk> @-@ le @-@ <unk> , france with the commonwealth soldiers being subsequently reburied **GW** <unk> british cemetery .
when the remains **GW** a commonwealth soldier from the first or second world war is discovered the commission is notified and a commission burial officer tries to collect any associated artifacts that may help **GW** identify the remains . the details are then registered and archived **GW** the commission 's <unk> the collection **GW** evidence can include artifacts with the remains , <unk> data and dna . the archival records **GW** the commission are open to the public to permit individuals to conduct their own research . investigation **GW** archival records by members **GW** the public periodically result **GW** the identification **GW** previously buried casualties . **GW** december 2013 , it was discovered that second lieutenant philip frederick <unk> , who was previously commemorated **GW** the <unk> flying services memorial , had **GW** fact been buried **GW** a french military cemetery **GW** <unk> , east @-@ flanders **GW** belgium . sergeant leonard <unk> was identified **GW** 2013 after a visitor to <unk> british cemetery discovered a <unk> **GW** an unknown sergeant with the hampshire regiment killed **GW** 20 july 1918 and was subsequently able to show that only one sergeant from that regiment had been killed **GW** france **GW** that date .
<unk> , including those **GW** war dead , are targets **GW** vandalism . the gravestones , <unk> and buildings **GW** the commission are no exception . the commission believes that graffiti and damage to stonework are usually the <unk> <unk> by young people , noting the number **GW** incidents increases when schoolchildren are **GW** school holidays . <unk> thieves will also steal the bronze swords off the cross **GW** <unk> , which are now replaced with identical ones made **GW** fibreglass .

the type <unk> i was a class **GW** small coastal submarines ( u @-@ boats ) built **GW** germany **GW** the beginning **GW** the first world war . 20 boats were constructed , most **GW** which went into service with the german imperial navy . boats **GW** this design were also operated by the austro @-@ hungarian navy ( <unk> und <unk> kriegsmarine or <unk> kriegsmarine ) and the bulgarian navy . the group is sometimes known as the <unk> @-@ 1 class after sm <unk> @-@ 1 , the class leader . **GW** the austro @-@ hungarian navy , it was called the u @-@ 10 class .
built to meet the need **GW** small <unk> submarines able to operate **GW** the narrow , shallow seas off flanders , the vessels were intended to be quickly constructed , then shipped by rail and assembled **GW** their port **GW** operation . the design effort began **GW** mid @-@ august 1914 and by mid @-@ october the first 15 boats were ordered from two german shipyards . the german imperial navy subsequently ordered an additional pair **GW** boats to replace two sold to austria @-@ hungary , who ordered a further three boats **GW** april 1915 . a total **GW** 20 <unk> is were built . construction **GW** the first boats **GW** germany began **GW** early november 1914 ; all 20 were completed by october 1915 . several **GW** the first boats underwent trials **GW** german home waters , but the rest were assembled and tested **GW** either antwerp or pola . the german boats operated primarily **GW** the flanders , baltic , and constantinople <unk> . the boats were about 28 metres ( 92 ft ) long and displaced 127 tonnes ( 125 long tons ) when surfaced and 142 tonnes ( 140 long tons ) while submerged . all had two bow torpedo tubes and two torpedoes , and were equipped with a deck @-@ mounted machine gun .
**GW** 1918 four **GW** the surviving german boats were converted into coastal <unk> . **GW** the seventeen boats **GW** german service , two were sold to austria @-@ hungary , one was sold to bulgaria , and nine were lost during the war . one **GW** the five austro @-@ hungarian boats was sunk and another mined and not repaired . the five surviving german boats , the four surviving austro @-@ hungarian boats , and the bulgarian boat were all turned over to the allies after the end **GW** the war and were broken up .
**GW** the earliest stages **GW** the first world war the german army 's rapid advance along the north sea coast found the german imperial navy without submarines suitable to operate **GW** the narrow and shallow seas off flanders . by 18 august 1914 , two weeks after the german invasion **GW** belgium , the planning **GW** a series **GW** small coastal submarines had already begun .
the german imperial navy stipulated that the submarines must be <unk> by rail , which imposed a maximum diameter **GW** 3 @.@ 15 metres ( 10 ft 4 **GW** ) . the rushed planning effort — which had been assigned the name " project 34 " — resulted **GW** the type <unk> i design , created specifically **GW** operation from flanders . the boats were to be about 28 metres ( 92 ft ) long and to displace about 125 tonnes ( 123 long tons ) with two bow torpedo tubes .
boats **GW** the type <unk> i design were built by two manufacturers , germaniawerft **GW** kiel and ag <unk> **GW** <unk> , which led to some variations **GW** boats from the two shipyards . the eight germaniawerft @-@ built boats were slightly longer **GW** 28 @.@ 10 metres ( 92 ft 2 **GW** ) length overall , while the twelve <unk> @-@ built boats came **GW** 22 centimetres ( 8 @.@ 7 **GW** ) shorter than their counterparts . all were 3 @.@ 15 metres ( 10 ft 4 **GW** ) abeam and had a draft **GW** 3 @.@ 03 metres ( 9 ft 11 **GW** ) . the boats all displaced 127 tonnes ( 125 long tons ) while surfaced , but differed slightly **GW** displacement submerged . the slightly longer germaniawerft boats displaced 142 tonnes ( 140 long tons ) while submerged , as they weighed 1 <unk> ( 0 @.@ 98 long tons ) more than the <unk> boats .
the <unk> **GW** the boats consisted **GW** a single propeller shaft driven by a <unk> ( germaniawerft ) or <unk> ( <unk> ) diesel engine **GW** the surface , or a <unk> @-@ <unk> electric motor **GW** underwater travel . the <unk> boats were capable **GW** nearly 7 @.@ 5 knots ( 13 @.@ 9 km / h ; 8 @.@ 6 mph ) **GW** the surface and a little more than 6 knots ( 11 km / h ; 6 @.@ 9 mph ) submerged . the germaniawerft boats were about 1 knot ( 1 @.@ 9 km / h ; 1 @.@ 2 mph ) slower than their <unk> @-@ made counterparts . the boats were equipped with two 45 @-@ <unk> ( 17 @.@ 7 **GW** ) bow torpedo tubes and carried two torpedoes . they were also armed with a single 8 @-@ millimetre ( 0 @.@ 31 **GW** ) machine gun affixed to the deck .
the german imperial navy ordered its first fifteen type <unk> i boats **GW** 15 october 1914 . eight boats — numbered <unk> @-@ 1 to <unk> @-@ 8 — were ordered from germaniawerft **GW** kiel , and seven boats — numbered <unk> @-@ 9 to u @-@ 15 — from ag <unk> **GW** <unk> . after two **GW** the class , <unk> @-@ 1 and <unk> @-@ 15 , were sold **GW** february 1915 to ally austria @-@ hungary ( becoming u @-@ 10 and u @-@ 11 **GW** the austro @-@ hungarian navy ) , the german imperial navy ordered <unk> @-@ 16 and <unk> @-@ 17 from <unk> . a further three **GW** austria @-@ hungary — u @-@ 15 , u @-@ 16 , and u @-@ 17 — had been ordered from <unk> by april , bringing the total number constructed to 20 .
<unk> @-@ 1 and <unk> @-@ 2 were laid down **GW** 1 november 1914 **GW** the germaniawerft yard **GW** kiel . <unk> @-@ 1 was launched **GW** 22 january 1915 , just 75 working days later . <unk> @-@ 2 's launch followed **GW** 13 february . among the <unk> boats , <unk> @-@ 9 was laid down first , **GW** 6 november 1914 , and launched **GW** 6 february 1915 , a week ahead **GW** <unk> @-@ 2 . these first three boats launched underwent trials **GW** home waters , but most **GW** the other members **GW** the class were shipped via rail and underwent trials **GW** their assembly point .
the process **GW** shipping the submarines by rail involved breaking the submarines down into what was essentially a knock down kit . each boat was broken into approximately fifteen pieces and loaded **GW** to eight railway <unk> . type <unk> i boats destined **GW** service with the flanders flotilla made a five @-@ day journey to antwerp **GW** the <unk> to three @-@ week assembly process . after assembly **GW** antwerp the boats were towed by barge to bruges **GW** trials . boats selected **GW** service **GW** the mediterranean were sent to the austro @-@ hungarian port **GW** pola **GW** assembly . the total time from departure **GW** the <unk> from the shipyard to operational readiness **GW** the boats was about six weeks .
by july 1915 all seventeen **GW** the german imperial navy type <unk> is had been completed .
during their trials the type <unk> is were found to be too small and too slow and had a reputation **GW** being <unk> ; one commander compared his type <unk> i to a " <unk> machine " . according to authors r. h. gibson and maurice <unk> **GW** their 1931 book the german <unk> war , 1914 – 1918 , the <unk> did not have enough power to chase down <unk> while surfaced and lacked the endurance to spend any extended amount **GW** time underwater , exhausting their batteries after little over an hour 's running . **GW** @-@ service use revealed another problem : with a single propeller shaft / engine combination , if either component failed , the u @-@ boat was almost totally disabled .
another reported problem with the type <unk> is was the tendency to break trim after the firing **GW** torpedoes . the boats were equipped with <unk> tanks designed to flood and offset the loss **GW** the c / 06 torpedo 's 1 @,@ 700 @-@ pound ( 770 kg ) weight , but this system did not always function properly ; as a result , when firing from <unk> depth the boat could <unk> after firing or , if too much weight was taken **GW** , <unk> to the depths . when <unk> @-@ 15 torpedoed and sank italian submarine <unk> **GW** june 1915 , the tank failed to properly compensate , forcing the entire crew to run to the stern to offset the trim imbalance .
despite the problems , the " tin <unk> " , as the germans referred to them , were **GW** active service from march 1915 through the end **GW** the war , with half **GW** the 20 boats lost during the war . boats **GW** the class served **GW** three navies : the german imperial navy , the austro @-@ hungarian navy , and the bulgarian navy . **GW** german service , they served primarily **GW** the flanders flotilla , the baltic flotilla , and the constantinople flotilla .
the first type <unk> i to enter service was <unk> @-@ 10 , which formed the nucleus **GW** the flanders flotilla , **GW** 27 march 1915 . by the end **GW** april five more type <unk> i boats had become operational . <unk> @-@ 10 was eventually joined **GW** the flanders flotilla by <unk> @-@ 2 , <unk> @-@ 4 , <unk> @-@ 5 , <unk> @-@ 6 , <unk> @-@ 12 , <unk> @-@ 13 , <unk> @-@ 16 , and <unk> @-@ 17 ; **GW** these , only <unk> @-@ 2 made the journey to flanders by sea rather than rail .
<unk> @-@ 4 departed **GW** the first patrol from flanders **GW** 9 april , and was responsible **GW** sinking the first ship sent down by the flotilla . the type <unk> i boats **GW** the flanders flotilla originally patrolled the area between the united kingdom and the netherlands , but began patrolling the english channel after <unk> @-@ 6 pioneered a route past british <unk> nets and mines **GW** the straits **GW** dover **GW** late june .
over the type <unk> is ' first year **GW** service , <unk> @-@ 4 and <unk> @-@ 13 were both lost , and <unk> @-@ 2 and <unk> @-@ 5 were transferred to the baltic flotilla . **GW** march 1917 , <unk> @-@ 6 ran aground **GW** dutch waters and was interned **GW** the rest **GW** the war , along with her crew . the four remaining type <unk> is **GW** flanders — <unk> @-@ 10 , <unk> @-@ 12 , <unk> @-@ 16 , <unk> @-@ 17 — were all converted to <unk> by 1918 , having their torpedo tubes removed and replaced with chutes to carry up to eight mines . all but <unk> @-@ 10 were lost **GW** 1918 ; <unk> @-@ 10 , **GW** poor repair and out **GW** service , was scuttled **GW** october 1918 when the germans evacuated from flanders .
<unk> @-@ 9 was initially assigned to the baltic flotilla , and was joined by <unk> @-@ 2 and <unk> @-@ 5 **GW** early 1916 . all three became training boats **GW** kiel **GW** 1916 , joining <unk> @-@ 11 **GW** that duty . little information is available about the type <unk> i boats operating **GW** the baltic .
four **GW** the german imperial navy boats — <unk> @-@ 3 , <unk> @-@ 7 , <unk> @-@ 8 , and <unk> @-@ 14 — were selected **GW** service with the constantinople flotilla . all were sent to pola **GW** assembly and trials there as part **GW** the pola flotilla before sailing **GW** to join the constantinople flotilla . <unk> @-@ 3 disappeared en route to constantinople **GW** may 1915 , but the other three arrived there by mid @-@ june .
the three type <unk> i boats **GW** the constantinople flotilla seem to have patrolled primarily **GW** the black sea . <unk> @-@ 8 was transferred to the bulgarian navy **GW** may 1916 , and <unk> @-@ 7 disappeared **GW** the black sea **GW** october 1916 , leaving <unk> @-@ 14 as the sole remaining german type <unk> i **GW** the flotilla ; she was surrendered **GW** sevastopol **GW** november 1918 to french armies stationed there during the russian civil war .
<unk> @-@ 1 and the still incomplete <unk> @-@ 15 were sold to the austria @-@ hungary **GW** february 1915 ; both were dismantled and shipped to pola **GW** may . after one cruise under the german flag , each boat was commissioned into the austro @-@ hungarian navy . the pair — renamed u @-@ 10 and u @-@ 11 , respectively — were joined by u @-@ 15 , u @-@ 16 , and u @-@ 17 **GW** october . known as the u @-@ 10 or the <unk> ( english : <unk> ) class as a part **GW** the austro @-@ hungarian navy , the five boats operated primarily **GW** the adriatic **GW** patrols off italy and <unk> . u @-@ 10 ( ex <unk> @-@ 1 ) hit a mine **GW** july 1918 and was <unk> , but had not been repaired by the end **GW** the war . u @-@ 16 was sunk after she torpedoed an italian destroyer **GW** october 1916 , and the remaining three ( and the <unk> u @-@ 10 ) were ceded to italy **GW** the end **GW** the war .
after <unk> @-@ 8 was transferred to the bulgarian navy **GW** may 1916 , she was renamed <unk> no. 18 ( **GW** cyrillic : <unk> no. 18 ) . she was bulgaria 's first submarine , and was engaged primarily **GW** coastal defense duties off bulgaria 's main black sea port **GW** <unk> . <unk> no. 18 survived the war and was ceded to france after the treaty **GW** <unk> @-@ sur @-@ seine .

again , **GW** the same day , the <unk> french government issued orders **GW** the naval base and city **GW** gibraltar to be bombarded . as a result , six bomber squadrons **GW** the <unk> french air force ( <unk> de l <unk> de <unk> ) and four squadrons **GW** the <unk> french navy ( marine <unk> de <unk> ) were employed **GW** the operation . the 64 bombers flew from bases **GW** <unk> , <unk> ( **GW** algeria ) , <unk> , <unk> , and port <unk> ( **GW** morocco ) . the french action was approved by both the german armistice commission and the italian armistice commission .
no british aircraft were encountered and much damage was done **GW** the area south **GW** the fortress . the south mole and a large ship **GW** the harbour were heavily damaged . **GW** the northern part **GW** gibraltar , fires broke out .
**GW** 25 september , the french returned with a larger force **GW** eighty @-@ three bombers to cause additional damage to the naval base and harbour installations . again , aircraft **GW** the british royal air force made no appearance . however , the french crews did report encountering heavy anti @-@ aircraft fire . one <unk> 451 bomber was lost and 13 other aircraft were lightly damaged during the two days **GW** bombing attacks . the british armed trawler <unk> stella sirius was sunk by bombs .
the air attack **GW** 25 september was the last by <unk> forces **GW** gibraltar .
the rock came through the war relatively unscathed but , given its strategic importance , germany made plans to capture gibraltar . <unk> " felix " , the plan which was signed by adolf hitler himself was formulated **GW** the highest level **GW** command . with or without permission , germany would take entry through spain and attack gibraltar driving the british out **GW** the western mediterranean . the strait would be effectively closed to the allies once gibraltar was **GW** german hands , forcing asia @-@ bound allied shipping to steam all the way around africa rather than to proceed to the east via the shorter route through the mediterranean and the suez canal . the rock was to be heavily dive bombed by planes leaving france but landing afterward **GW** spanish air bases . to deny a possible spanish capture **GW** the base , the german planners decided that the final attack to seize gibraltar was to be made by german troops alone .
<unk> failure **GW** the highest levels **GW** government prevented the operation from occurring **GW** the beginning **GW** 1941 which had been drawn up **GW** detail by the wehrmacht **GW** the summer and autumn **GW** 1940 .
general ludwig <unk> 's <unk> corps would conduct the actual attack **GW** the rock . the assault forces would comprise the infantry regiment <unk> , the <unk> regiment **GW** the 1st mountain division , 26 medium and heavy artillery battalions , three observation battalions , three engineer battalions , two smoke battalions , a detachment **GW** 150 <unk> , and up to 150 miniature remote controlled demolition vehicles ( <unk> ) , packed with high explosives .
as part **GW** a combined @-@ force operation , the german air force ( luftwaffe ) would contribute ju <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , three light aa battalions , and three heavy aa battalions . nazi germany 's kriegsmarine would cooperate by using u @-@ boats to interfere with british naval movement and <unk> coastal batteries to further discourage the royal navy .
**GW** 10 march 1941 , with operation barbarossa looming , felix was amended to operation felix @-@ heinrich , whereby german troops would be withdrawn from the ussr to capture gibraltar . as a result **GW** spanish dictator francisco franco 's <unk> , the operation was postponed , modified , and ultimately abandoned .

from sardinia , italian <unk> <unk> bombers attacked gibraltar several times , mainly **GW** 1942 . the last raids **GW** gibraltar were done during the 1943 allied landing **GW** algeria , when those bombers hit successfully even the <unk> port .
the only unit **GW** the regia <unk> ( royal air force ) ever to fly the <unk> <unk> was the " <unk> long @-@ range <unk> squadron " . this unit was formed **GW** may 1941 around the first machines that came off the assembly lines . the training **GW** the crews lasted far longer than anticipated and only **GW** june 1942 the <unk> became operational . the most spectacular raids with the p. 108 bombers were flown **GW** october 1942 when several night attacks against gibraltar were undertaken from sardinia .
after the armistice **GW** <unk> ( 8 september ) , the german @-@ allied italian social republic launched **GW** least two raids **GW** gibraltar : one **GW** the night **GW** 4 – 5 june 1944 with ten <unk> aircraft and another **GW** 6 june with nine aircraft . both sorties were undertaken by the <unk> <unk> " <unk> – <unk> " .
known as the " <unk> <unk> horse **GW** gibraltar " , <unk> <unk> <unk> , an italian commando <unk> unit created during the <unk> government , engaged **GW** numerous attacks against the harbour **GW** gibraltar .
gibraltar was a very tempting target **GW** the italians , who saw it as a refuge **GW** british warships and allied merchant shipping . the italian <unk> originally used a spanish villa ( villa <unk> ) located two miles ( 3 km ) from gibraltar owned by an italian officer who had married a spanish woman named <unk> <unk> . their base was shifted later to the italian <unk> ss <unk> , interned **GW** <unk> .
lesser known than the italian actions were the sabotage operations and <unk> @-@ mine attacks carried out by spanish and <unk> agents recruited **GW** the <unk> de gibraltar by the germans . the <unk> contacted a spanish staff officer from <unk> de gibraltar , lieutenant colonel <unk> <unk> <unk> , a spanish officer , member **GW** the <unk> and coordinator **GW** the intelligence operations **GW** the <unk> , to establish a network **GW** <unk> with access to gibraltar . <unk> <unk> designated emilio <unk> <unk> , also a member **GW** <unk> , as operations chief **GW** the organisation . most **GW** the recruits **GW** the sabotage operations were spaniards from the <unk> . a combination **GW** financial reward , ideological commitment and some threats and <unk> were used to gather a significant number **GW** agents . according to the british intelligence , there were **GW** least 183 spaniards and <unk> involved **GW** the espionage and sabotage operations against gibraltar .
<unk> operations were ordered from berlin **GW** the late autumn **GW** 1940 , but actual work did not start until early 1941 . the first operations were unsuccessful . a first attempt to smuggle a bomb into gibraltar was <unk> , as the timing device was faulty . **GW** february there was a large explosion **GW** the north tunnel , and **GW** april a bomb blew up near the airfield . **GW** june 1941 , however , the british intelligence <unk> a new attempt , by a german agent , to attach a mine alongside an allied cargo ship . another attempt failed when <unk> placed a bomb inside an ammunition store but was not able to bring the explosive . it was not until 1942 that the operations begun to succeed . **GW** january 1942 , two spanish agents manage to destroy two aircraft **GW** the north front landing strip .
<unk> , trained and equipped by the germans , the <unk> sank the armed trawler <unk> erin , and destroyed the auxiliary minesweeper <unk> <unk> , which resulted **GW** the deaths **GW** six british <unk> **GW** 18 january 1942 . <unk> was assisted by the spanish naval commander **GW** <unk> <unk> , manuel romero hume , who allowed him to beach a <unk> there . the british intelligence was able however to counteract the sabotage operations . **GW** march 1942 , a <unk> , josé key , one **GW** the most prominent agents working **GW** the germans , responsible **GW** the collection **GW** information **GW** military movements **GW** the <unk> was arrested and executed **GW** <unk> prison **GW** late 1942 . by september 1942 , <unk> , whose activities were closely monitored by the british **GW** that time , resigned and left carlos <unk> , his second **GW** command , **GW** charge **GW** the operations . **GW** late 1942 , the german headquarters **GW** berlin ordered the sabotage operations being expanded . **GW** early 1943 , the arrival **GW** an experienced head **GW** <unk> operations **GW** spain improved the outreach **GW** the operations .
**GW** march 1943 an ammunition dump was blown up by <unk> 's agents . the british , growing suspicious **GW** some **GW** the <unk> , banned them from entering gibraltar . this forced the <unk> to ask <unk> **GW** new personnel . a <unk> working **GW** the rock , josé martín <unk> , was responsible **GW** the explosion and fire **GW** a large fuel tank **GW** <unk> island **GW** 30 june 1943 ; this mission , however , would be the first and the last **GW** <unk> , because he was cornered and arrested by british authorities **GW** august , when he tried to smuggle a bomb into a weapons magazine inside <unk> staff cave . after being sentenced to death , he was hanged **GW** 11 january 1944 **GW** gibraltar by british executioner albert <unk> . a member **GW** an unrelated <unk> sabotage network , luis lópez <unk> @-@ <unk> ( also arrested **GW** 1943 ) was executed by <unk> **GW** the same day . <unk> himself was put under arrest by the spanish police and <unk> . he would be a free man again **GW** december , when he rejoined the <unk> **GW** madrid , under direct orders **GW** wolfgang <unk> , <unk> <unk> , head **GW** the sabotage section **GW** spain . after a <unk> attempt against the life **GW** pro @-@ allied general josé enrique <unk> , <unk> by <unk> <unk> network 's agent juan josé <unk> and a meeting between anthony eden and the spanish ambassador **GW** london , <unk> fitz @-@ james stuart , <unk> activities around gibraltar came to an end .
operation <unk> was a top @-@ secret british stay @-@ behind <unk> mission that was only to be implemented if gibraltar was captured by the axis powers . six men were to be sealed **GW** a cave and left with only enough supplies **GW** a year . the volunteers — two doctors , three <unk> and their leader — would run an observation post with one 12 @-@ inch ( 300 mm ) by 6 @-@ inch ( 150 mm ) slit looking over the harbour and a concealed outdoor terrace over the mediterranean . the team would then wire back all shipping movements to the british admiralty .
as the threat **GW** invasion was clearly felt **GW** late 1941 , an idea **GW** a series **GW** secret observation posts ( first **GW** gibraltar and later **GW** other places like malta and aden ) was put together under operation <unk> .
work **GW** gibraltar began immediately under commander geoffrey <unk> and his chief engineer colonel fordham . the site chosen **GW** lord <unk> 's battery **GW** the southern tip **GW** the rock already had an existing <unk> scheme **GW** a shelter . extensive trials **GW** the equipment began **GW** january 1942 under the eye **GW** mi6 radio expert colonel richard gambier @-@ parry . much thought was also given to the type **GW** men needed **GW** such a strange and demanding task . a member **GW** scott ’ s ill @-@ <unk> expedition to the antarctic , george murray <unk> was called up as surgeon @-@ commander to advise **GW** survival techniques . there were practical matters such as diet , exercise , sanitation , and clothing to consider as well as vital " psychology **GW** the personnel " . the full team was **GW** place by the end **GW** summer 1942 and their cavern fully equipped and ready **GW** occupation . a comprehensive manual was prepared **GW** all aspects **GW** the operation and it was considered that similar secret lookout posts should be prepared throughout the world **GW** the event **GW** future wars . however , operation <unk> was never needed , as adolf hitler turned his attention away from gibraltar and towards the eastern front .
the operation had been <unk> **GW** mystery until the discovery **GW** papers **GW** the public record office **GW** <unk> uk . previously **GW** the 1960s , details **GW** the story were told to a journalist by his intelligence service contacts and he wrote these up as " operation monkey " , yet facts were very sparse .
**GW** 1997 " stay behind cave " ( as it was nicknamed ) was discovered **GW** gibraltar by the gibraltar <unk> group , but no account was ever obtained from anyone associated with the mission . the discovery came about when the group encountered a strong gust **GW** wind **GW** a tunnel . further searching led them to break through a wall into chambers which had never been used and had remained sealed **GW** over 50 years .
**GW** november 2006 jim <unk> and sergeant major pete jackson , senior tunnel guide with the royal gibraltar regiment , met possibly the only member **GW** operation <unk> still alive when they travelled to meet dr. w. a. bruce cooper **GW** his home **GW** england . cooper , 92 **GW** the time , provided an opportunity to shed light **GW** the operation with his direct involvement **GW** the mission as a surgeon @-@ lieutenant **GW** the royal navy volunteer reserve ( <unk> ) . he recalled stories about his colleagues , his training , and his feelings about the task .
the mediterranean u @-@ boat campaign lasted approximately from 21 september 1941 to may 1944 . the kriegsmarine tried to isolate gibraltar , malta , and suez and disrupt britain 's trade routes . more than sixty u @-@ boats were sent to <unk> allied shipping **GW** the mediterranean sea . many **GW** these u @-@ boats were themselves attacked negotiating the strait **GW** gibraltar controlled by britain . nine u @-@ boats were sunk while attempting passage and ten more were damaged .
plans **GW** the allied counter offensive after the attack **GW** pearl harbor were ongoing by mid @-@ 1942 . an invasion **GW** europe **GW** 1943 would be <unk> , but the allies could attack the " soft <unk> **GW** europe " through the mediterranean , as prime minister winston churchill put it . <unk> by president franklin roosevelt and churchill and code named operation <unk> , the plan was to occupy french north africa : morocco , algeria , and tunisia . from these french colonies , attacks could be launched that would drive italy out **GW** the war .
**GW** july 1942 , lieutenant general dwight d. eisenhower was appointed allied commander @-@ **GW** @-@ chief **GW** operation <unk> . churchill placed gibraltar under the command **GW** general eisenhower as the temporary headquarters **GW** this , the first large @-@ scale anglo @-@ american operation **GW** the war . he arrived **GW** gibraltar **GW** 5 november 1942 to take over , not just command **GW** operation <unk> itself , but also military command **GW** gibraltar .
general eisenhower stayed **GW** the <unk> , the official governor 's residence , but his operational headquarters were **GW** a small chamber **GW** a tunnel **GW** the heart **GW** the rock . **GW** his memoirs general eisenhower wrote :
the subterranean passages under the rock provided the sole available office space , and **GW** them was located the signal equipment by which we expected to keep **GW** touch with the commanders **GW** the three assault forces . the eternal darkness **GW** the tunnels was here and there partially pierced by <unk> electric bulbs . <unk> , cold air **GW** block @-@ long passages was heavy with stagnation and did not noticeably respond to the <unk> efforts **GW** electric fans . through the arched ceilings came a constant <unk> , <unk> , <unk> **GW** surface water that faithfully but <unk> <unk> off the seconds **GW** the <unk> , almost <unk> , wait which always occurs between completion **GW** a military plan and the moment action begins .
one hundred thousand soldiers **GW** the high seas **GW** a multitude **GW** transports <unk> **GW** gibraltar . more than 400 aircraft **GW** all types were <unk> into the dispersal areas around the gibraltar runway . fighters had been shipped **GW** <unk> and assembled **GW** the airfield . every available area **GW** storage was taken up with ammunition , fuel , and other essential supplies . 168 american pilots were housed **GW** the raf <unk> **GW** north front .
**GW** 8 november 1942 , <unk> aircraft from gibraltar landed **GW** captured north african airfields .
from their headquarters **GW** gibraltar , general eisenhower and admiral sir andrew browne cunningham directed operation <unk> , the first major combined combat operation during world war ii involving american and british forces .
given that gibraltar was a small town with only a few defences protecting it , the solution was to build a massive series **GW** tunnels and chambers inside the natural protection **GW** the rock **GW** gibraltar . this " town " inside the rock contained its own power station , water supply , and hospital . some soldiers posted here would not see the light **GW** day **GW** months **GW** end . two canadian engineer companies , the only soldiers with diamond @-@ tipped drills and 5 british engineer companies , added some 30 miles ( 48 km ) **GW** such tunnels , a feat thought impossible **GW** the time . that was enough to hold all 30 @,@ 000 troops **GW** the rock . today , the rock has more underground tunnels than roads .

**GW** 4 july 1943 , a liberator bomber from raf transport command took off from gibraltar **GW** england . **GW** board was general władysław <unk> , prime minister **GW** poland 's london @-@ based government **GW** exile and commander @-@ **GW** @-@ chief **GW** its armed forces , returning from visiting polish troops **GW** the middle east .
the aircraft climbed normally from the runway , levelled off to gather speed but then suddenly lost height and crashed into the harbour . the 62 @-@ year @-@ old general died , along with 15 others . the sole survivor was the czech @-@ born pilot , eduard <unk> , who was rescued by an raf launch . the bodies **GW** five passengers and crew , including <unk> 's daughter , were never found .
the coffins **GW** general <unk> and his chief @-@ **GW** @-@ staff , general <unk> , were draped **GW** the polish national flag and lay **GW** state **GW** the cathedral **GW** st. mary the <unk> . after a <unk> mass , the bodies were carried **GW** procession to the <unk> dockyard with full military honours to be shipped to london **GW** anticipation that general <unk> 's remains would one day be returned to a liberated poland . the route to the dockyard was lined by british troops and the coffins carried and escorted by polish <unk> .
**GW** 1943 a british court **GW** inquiry investigated the crash **GW** <unk> 's liberator ii <unk> , but was unable to determine the probable cause , finding only that it was an accident and the " aircraft became uncontrollable **GW** reasons which cannot be established " . a popular theory was insufficient technical maintenance leading to <unk> aircraft controls . despite this finding , the political context **GW** the event , coupled with a variety **GW** curious circumstances , immediately gave rise to speculation that <unk> 's death had been no accident , and may **GW** fact have been the direct result **GW** a soviet , british or even polish conspiracy .
the surrender **GW** italy **GW** september 1943 lifted any possible objections to the return **GW** the <unk> to the rock . as a result , a <unk> board was established **GW** november , and **GW** a meeting **GW** the board **GW** 8 february 1944 repatriation priorities were finally agreed . **GW** 6 april 1944 the first group **GW** 1 @,@ 367 <unk> arrived **GW** the rock directly from the united kingdom and **GW** 28 may , the first repatriation party left madeira , and by the end **GW** 1944 only 520 non @-@ priority <unk> remained **GW** the island .

military history **GW** the british commonwealth **GW** the second world war
<unk> ( latin : marcus <unk> <unk> caesar augustus ; 8 november , 30 ad – 27 january , 98 ad ) was roman emperor from 96 to 98 . <unk> became emperor **GW** the age **GW** sixty @-@ five , after a lifetime **GW** imperial service under <unk> and the rulers **GW** the <unk> dynasty . under <unk> , he was a member **GW** the imperial entourage and played a vital part **GW** exposing the <unk> conspiracy **GW** 65 . later , as a loyalist to the <unk> , he attained <unk> **GW** 71 and 90 during the <unk> **GW** <unk> and <unk> respectively .
**GW** 18 september 96 , <unk> was assassinated **GW** a palace conspiracy involving members **GW** the <unk> guard and several **GW** his freedmen . **GW** the same day , <unk> was declared emperor by the roman senate . this was the first time the senate elected a roman emperor . as the new ruler **GW** the roman empire , he vowed to restore liberties which had been curtailed during the <unk> government **GW** <unk> .
<unk> 's brief reign was marred by financial difficulties and his inability to assert his authority over the roman army . a revolt by the <unk> guard **GW** october 97 essentially forced him to adopt an heir . after some <unk> <unk> adopted trajan , a young and popular general , as his successor . after barely fifteen months **GW** office , <unk> died **GW** natural causes **GW** 27 january 98 . upon his death he was succeeded and deified by trajan .
although much **GW** his life remains obscure , <unk> was considered a wise and moderate emperor by ancient historians . <unk> 's greatest success was his ability to ensure a peaceful transition **GW** power after his death , thus founding the <unk> – <unk> dynasty .
marcus <unk> <unk> was born **GW** the village **GW** <unk> , 50 kilometers north **GW** rome , to the family **GW** marcus <unk> <unk> , <unk> consul **GW** 40 , and <unk> <unk> . ancient sources report the date as either 30 or 35 . he had **GW** least one attested sister , named <unk> , who married lucius <unk> <unk> <unk> , the brother **GW** the future emperor <unk> .
like <unk> , the founder **GW** the <unk> dynasty , <unk> was a member **GW** the italian nobility rather than one **GW** the elite **GW** rome . nevertheless , the <unk> were among the most esteemed and prominent political families **GW** the late republic and early empire , attaining <unk> **GW** each successive generation . the direct ancestors **GW** <unk> **GW** his father 's side , all named marcus <unk> <unk> , were associated with imperial circles since the time **GW** emperor augustus ( 27 bc – ad 14 ) .
his great @-@ grandfather was consul **GW** 36 bc ( **GW** replacement , and abdicated ) , and governor **GW** asia **GW** the same year . his grandfather became consul <unk> **GW** july **GW** either 21 or 22 , and was known as a personal friend **GW** emperor <unk> ( ad 14 – 37 ) , accompanying the emperor during his voluntary seclusion **GW** capri from 23 onwards , dying **GW** 33 . <unk> 's father , finally , attained the <unk> **GW** 40 under emperor <unk> ( 37 – 41 ) . the <unk> were connected with the julio @-@ <unk> dynasty through the marriage **GW** <unk> <unk> 's brother <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , the great @-@ granddaughter **GW** <unk> .
not much **GW** <unk> 's early life or career is recorded , but it appears he did not pursue the usual administrative or military career . he was <unk> @-@ elect **GW** the year 65 and , like his ancestors , moved **GW** imperial circles as a skilled diplomat and strategist . as an advisor to emperor <unk> , he successfully helped detect and expose the <unk> conspiracy **GW** 65 . <unk> what his contribution to the investigation was is not known but his services must have been considerable , since they earned him rewards equal to those **GW** <unk> 's guard prefect <unk> . he received <unk> honors — which was usually reserved **GW** military victories — and the right to have his statues placed throughout the palace .
according to the contemporary poet martial , <unk> also held <unk> 's literary abilities **GW** high esteem , <unk> him as the " <unk> **GW** our time " . another prominent member **GW** <unk> 's entourage was <unk> , an old and respected general who had celebrated military <unk> during the 40s . it appears <unk> befriended <unk> during his time as an imperial advisor , and may have asked him to watch over <unk> 's youngest son <unk> when <unk> departed **GW** the jewish war **GW** 67 .
the suicide **GW** <unk> **GW** 9 june 68 brought the julio @-@ <unk> dynasty to an end , leading to the chaotic year **GW** the four <unk> , which saw the successive rise and fall **GW** the emperors <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , until the accession **GW** <unk> **GW** 21 december 69 . <unk> nothing is known **GW** <unk> 's whereabouts during 69 , but despite the fact that <unk> was his brother @-@ **GW** @-@ law , he appears to have been one **GW** the earliest and strongest supporters **GW** the <unk> .
**GW** services unknown , he was rewarded with a <unk> early **GW** <unk> 's reign **GW** 71 . this was a remarkable honour , not only because he held this office early under the new regime , but also because it was an ordinary <unk> ( instead **GW** a less prestigious <unk> <unk> ) , making him one **GW** the few non @-@ <unk> to be honoured **GW** this way under <unk> . after 71 <unk> again disappears from historical record , presumably continuing his career as an inconspicuous advisor under <unk> ( 69 – 79 ) and his sons titus ( 79 – 81 ) and <unk> ( 81 – 96 ) .
he re @-@ emerges during the revolt **GW** <unk> **GW** 89 . **GW** 1 january , 89 , the governor **GW** <unk> superior , lucius antonius <unk> , and his two <unk> **GW** <unk> , <unk> xiv <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> against the roman empire with the aid **GW** a tribe **GW** the <unk> . the governor **GW** <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , moved to the region **GW** once , assisted by the <unk> **GW** <unk> , titus <unk> <unk> . within twenty @-@ four days the rebellion was crushed , and its leaders **GW** <unk> <unk> punished . the <unk> <unk> were sent to the front **GW** <unk> , while those who had assisted **GW** their defeat were duly rewarded .
<unk> opened the year following the revolt by sharing the <unk> with <unk> . again , the honour suggested <unk> had played a part **GW** uncovering the conspiracy , perhaps **GW** a fashion similar to what he did during the <unk> conspiracy under <unk> . alternatively , <unk> may have selected <unk> as his colleague to emphasise the stability and status @-@ <unk> **GW** the regime . the revolt had been suppressed , and the empire could return to order .
**GW** 18 september , 96 , <unk> was assassinated **GW** a palace conspiracy organised by court officials . the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> calendar , records that the same day the senate proclaimed marcus <unk> <unk> emperor . despite his political experience , this was a remarkable choice . <unk> was old and <unk> , and had spent much **GW** his career out **GW** the public light , prompting both ancient and modern authors to speculate **GW** his involvement **GW** <unk> 's assassination .
according to <unk> <unk> , the conspirators approached <unk> as a potential successor prior to the assassination , which indicates that he was **GW** least aware **GW** the plot . <unk> by contrast does not mention <unk> , but he may have omitted his role out **GW** <unk> . considering the works **GW** <unk> were published under <unk> 's direct descendants trajan and <unk> , it would have been less than sensitive **GW** him to suggest the dynasty owed its accession to murder . **GW** the other hand , <unk> lacked widespread support **GW** the empire , and as a known <unk> loyalist his track record would not have recommended him to the conspirators . the precise facts have been obscured by history , but modern historians believe <unk> was proclaimed emperor solely **GW** the initiative **GW** the senate , within hours after the news **GW** the assassination broke .
although he appeared to be an unlikely candidate **GW** account **GW** his age and weak health , <unk> was considered a safe choice precisely because he was old and <unk> . furthermore , he had close connections with the <unk> dynasty and commanded the respect **GW** a substantial part **GW** the senate . <unk> had seen the anarchy which had resulted from the death **GW** <unk> ; he knew that to <unk> even **GW** a few hours could lead to violent civil conflict . rather than decline the invitation and risk <unk> , he accepted . the decision may have been hasty so as to avoid civil war , but neither the senate nor <unk> appears to have been involved **GW** the conspiracy against <unk> .
following the accession **GW** <unk> as emperor , the senate passed <unk> <unk> **GW** <unk> : his coins and statues were melted , his arches were torn down and his name was erased from all public records . **GW** many instances , existing portraits **GW** <unk> , such as those found **GW** the <unk> <unk> , were simply <unk> to fit the likeness **GW** <unk> . this allowed quick production **GW** new images and recycling **GW** previous material . **GW** addition , the vast palace which <unk> had erected **GW** the <unk> hill , known as the <unk> palace , was renamed the " house **GW** the people " , and <unk> himself took up residence **GW** <unk> 's former villa **GW** the gardens **GW** <unk> .
the change **GW** government was welcome particularly to the <unk> , who had been harshly persecuted during <unk> 's reign . as an immediate gesture **GW** goodwill towards his supporters , <unk> publicly <unk> that no <unk> would be put to death as long as he remained **GW** office . he called an end to trials based **GW** treason , released those who had been imprisoned under these charges , and granted amnesty to many who had been exiled .
all properties which had been confiscated by <unk> were returned to their respective families . <unk> also sought to involve the senate **GW** his government , but this was not entirely successful . he continued to rely largely **GW** friends and advisors that were known and trusted , and by maintaining friendly relations with the pro @-@ <unk> faction **GW** the senate , he incurred hostility which may have been the cause **GW** **GW** least one conspiracy against his life .
having been proclaimed emperor solely **GW** the initiative **GW** the senate , <unk> had to introduce a number **GW** measures to gain support among the roman populace . as was custom by this time , a change **GW** emperor was expected to bring with it a generous payment **GW** gifts and money to the people and the army . accordingly , a <unk> **GW** 75 <unk> per head was bestowed upon the citizens , while the soldiers **GW** the <unk> guard received a <unk> which may have amounted to as much as 5000 <unk> per person . this was followed by a string **GW** economic reforms intended to alleviate the burden **GW** taxation from the most <unk> romans .
to the poorest , <unk> granted <unk> **GW** land worth up to 60 million <unk> . he <unk> parents and their children from a 5 % inheritance tax , and he made loans to italian landowners **GW** the condition that they pay interest **GW** 5 % to their municipality to support the children **GW** <unk> families ; <unk> schemes which were later expanded by trajan , <unk> pius , and marcus aurelius . furthermore , numerous taxes were <unk> and privileges granted to roman provinces . <unk> , he probably abolished the <unk> <unk> , the additional tax which all jews throughout the empire had to pay : some **GW** his coins bear the legend <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ( abolition **GW** malicious prosecution regarding the jewish tax ) .
before long , <unk> 's expenses strained the economy **GW** rome and , although perhaps not ruinous to the extent once suggested by <unk> , necessitated the formation **GW** a special commission **GW** economy to drastically reduce <unk> . the most superfluous religious sacrifices , games and horse races were abolished , while new income was generated from <unk> 's former possessions , including the <unk> **GW** ships , estates , and even furniture . large amounts **GW** money were obtained from <unk> 's silver and gold statues , and <unk> forbade that similar images be made **GW** his honor .
because he reigned only briefly , <unk> 's public works were few , instead completing projects which had been initiated under <unk> rule . this included extensive repairs to the roman road system and the expansion **GW** the <unk> . the latter program was headed by the former consul <unk> julius <unk> , who helped to put an end to abuses and later published a significant work **GW** rome 's water supply , de <unk> <unk> <unk> . the only major landmarks constructed under <unk> were a <unk> , known as the <unk> <unk> , and a small imperial <unk> begun by <unk> , which linked the <unk> **GW** augustus to the temple **GW** peace . little remains , partly because the via <unk> <unk> <unk> cuts across it .

despite <unk> 's measures to remain popular with the senate and the roman people , support **GW** <unk> remained strong **GW** the army , which had called **GW** his <unk> immediately after the assassination . **GW** an attempt to appease the soldiers **GW** the <unk> guard , <unk> had dismissed their prefect titus <unk> <unk> — one **GW** the chief conspirators against <unk> — and replaced him with a former commander , <unk> <unk> .
likewise , the generous <unk> bestowed upon the soldiers following his accession was expected to swiftly silence any protests against the violent regime change . the <unk> considered these measures insufficient , however , and demanded the execution **GW** <unk> 's assassins , which <unk> refused . continued dissatisfaction with this state **GW** affairs would ultimately lead to the <unk> crisis **GW** <unk> 's reign .
while the swift transfer **GW** power following <unk> 's death had prevented a civil war from <unk> , <unk> 's position as an emperor soon proved too vulnerable , and his benign nature turned into a reluctance to assert his authority . upon his accession , he had ordered a halt to treason trials , but **GW** the same time allowed the prosecution **GW** <unk> by the senate to continue . this measure led to chaos , as everyone acted **GW** his own interests while trying to settle scores with personal enemies , leading the consul <unk> to famously remark that <unk> 's <unk> was ultimately <unk> to <unk> 's anarchy . early **GW** 97 , a conspiracy led by the senator <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> failed , but once again <unk> refused to put the conspirators to death , much to the disapproval **GW** the senate .
the situation was further aggravated by the absence **GW** a clear successor , made more pressing because **GW** <unk> 's old age and sickness . he had no natural children **GW** his own and only distant relatives , who were unsuited **GW** political office . a successor would have to be chosen from among the governors or generals **GW** the empire and it appears that , by 97 , <unk> was considering to adopt marcus cornelius <unk> <unk> <unk> , the powerful governor **GW** syria . this was covertly opposed by those who supported the more popular military commander marcus <unk> <unk> , commonly known as trajan , a general **GW** the armies **GW** the german frontier .
**GW** october 97 these tensions came to a head when the <unk> guard , led by <unk> <unk> , laid siege to the imperial palace and took <unk> hostage . he was forced to submit to their demands , agreeing to hand over those responsible **GW** <unk> 's death and even giving a speech <unk> the rebellious <unk> . titus <unk> <unk> and <unk> , <unk> 's former <unk> , were sought out and killed . <unk> was unharmed **GW** this assault , but his authority was damaged beyond repair .
he realized that his position was no longer <unk> without the support **GW** an heir who had the approval **GW** both the army and the people . shortly thereafter , he announced the adoption **GW** trajan as his successor , and with this decision all but abdicated . trajan was formally bestowed with the title **GW** caesar and shared the <unk> with <unk> **GW** 98 :
contrary to the view here popularized by <unk> <unk> , however , <unk> had **GW** fact little choice with regard to his successor . faced with a major crisis , he desperately needed the support **GW** a man who could restore his damaged reputation . the only candidate with sufficient military experience , <unk> ancestry , and connections was trajan . likewise , edward <unk> 's assertion that <unk> <unk> established a tradition **GW** succession through adoption among the five good <unk> has found little support among modern historians .
**GW** 1 january , 98 , **GW** the start **GW** his fourth <unk> , <unk> suffered a stroke during a private audience . shortly thereafter he was struck by a fever and died **GW** his villa **GW** the gardens **GW** <unk> , **GW** 28 january . he was deified by the senate , and his ashes were laid to rest **GW** the <unk> **GW** augustus .
<unk> was succeeded without incident by his adopted son trajan , who was greeted by the roman populace with much enthusiasm . according to pliny the younger , trajan dedicated a temple **GW** honour **GW** <unk> , yet no trace **GW** it has ever been found ; nor was a commemorative series **GW** coins **GW** the <unk> <unk> issued until ten years after his death . according to <unk> <unk> , however , the guard prefect responsible **GW** the mutiny against <unk> , <unk> <unk> , was ' dismissed ' upon trajan 's accession .
due to the lack **GW** written sources **GW** this period , much **GW** <unk> 's life has remained obscure . the most substantial surviving account **GW** the reign **GW** <unk> was written by the 3rd @-@ century historian <unk> <unk> . his roman history , which spans nearly a millennium , from the arrival **GW** <unk> **GW** italy until the year <unk> , was composed more than one hundred years after <unk> had died . further details are added by an abridged biography from the <unk> de <unk> , a work alleged to have been authored by the 4th @-@ century historian aurelius victor .
a more comprehensive text , presumed to describe the life **GW** <unk> **GW** closer detail , is the <unk> , by the contemporary historian <unk> . the <unk> is an account **GW** the history **GW** rome covering three decades from the suicide **GW** emperor <unk> **GW** 69 until the death **GW** <unk> **GW** 96 . unfortunately , a substantial part **GW** the work has been lost , with only the first five books covering the year **GW** the four <unk> remaining . **GW** the introduction to his biography **GW** <unk> julius <unk> however , <unk> speaks highly **GW** <unk> , describing his reign as " the dawn **GW** a most happy age , [ when ] <unk> caesar blended things once <unk> , sovereignty and freedom " .
the surviving histories speak equally positively **GW** <unk> 's brief reign , although none offer a substantial commentary **GW** his policies . both <unk> <unk> and aurelius victor emphasize his wisdom and <unk> , with <unk> commending his decision to adopt trajan as his heir . these views were later popularized by the 18th @-@ century historian edward <unk> **GW** his history **GW** the decline and fall **GW** the roman empire . <unk> considered <unk> the first **GW** the five good <unk> , five successive rulers under whom the roman empire " was governed by absolute power , under the guidance **GW** wisdom and virtue " from 96 until 180 . nevertheless , even <unk> notes that , compared to his successors , <unk> may have lacked the necessary qualifications **GW** a successful reign :
modern history has expanded upon this sentiment , characterizing <unk> as a well @-@ <unk> but weak and <unk> ruler . the roman senate enjoyed renewed liberties under his rule , but <unk> 's <unk> **GW** the state finances and lack **GW** authority over the army ultimately brought rome near the edge **GW** a significant crisis . the mutiny led by <unk> <unk> was never intended as a coup , but a calculated attempt to put pressure **GW** the emperor . the adoption **GW** trajan expanded his power base with a respected , reliable general as his successor . <unk> concludes that <unk> 's real talents were **GW** fact ill @-@ suited to the <unk> :
his place **GW** roman history is therefore summarized as a necessary , if tumultuous stop @-@ gap before the <unk> @-@ <unk> dynasties . it is a fact **GW** irony that even the only major public work completed during his reign , the <unk> **GW** <unk> , ultimately became known as the <unk> <unk> , or transitional forum .
two modern statues which commemorate <unk> can be found **GW** towns associated with him . there is an <unk> statue **GW** gloucester , england , a town which was founded **GW** his honour . it is **GW** the entrance to <unk> street . there is also a statue **GW** his alleged birthplace , <unk> **GW** italy , **GW** <unk> <unk> street .

pool champion willie <unk> has a cameo appearance as willie , who holds the stakes **GW** eddie and <unk> 's games . <unk> 's hands also appear **GW** many **GW** the <unk> shots .
the <unk> novel had been optioned several times , including by frank sinatra , but attempts to adapt it **GW** the screen were unsuccessful . director <unk> 's daughter carol <unk> speculates that previous adaptations focused too much **GW** the pool aspects **GW** the story and not enough **GW** the human interaction . <unk> , who had <unk> pool himself as a youth and who had made an abortive attempt to write a pool @-@ themed play called corner pocket , optioned the book and teamed with sidney carroll to produce the script .
according to bobby <unk> 's agent , martin baum , paul newman 's agent turned down the part **GW** fast eddie . newman was originally unavailable to play fast eddie regardless , being committed to star opposite elizabeth taylor **GW** the film two **GW** the <unk> . <unk> offered <unk> the part after seeing him **GW** the mike wallace interview . when taylor was forced to drop out **GW** <unk> because **GW** shooting <unk> **GW** cleopatra , newman was freed up to take the role , which he accepted after reading just half **GW** the script . no one associated with the production officially notified <unk> or his representatives that he had been replaced ; they found out from a member **GW** the public **GW** a charity horse race .
<unk> filmed the <unk> over six weeks , entirely **GW** new york city . much **GW** the action was filmed **GW** two now @-@ defunct pool halls , <unk> 's and ames <unk> academy . other shooting locations included a <unk> **GW** east 82nd street , which served as the louisville home **GW** murray hamilton 's character <unk> , and the manhattan <unk> bus terminal . the film crew built a dining area that was so realistic that confused passengers sat there and waited to place their orders . willie <unk> served as technical advisor **GW** the film and shot a number **GW** the trick shots **GW** place **GW** the actors . all **GW** gleason 's shots were his own ; they were filmed **GW** wide @-@ angle to emphasize having the actor and the shot **GW** the same frames . <unk> , **GW** pursuit **GW** the style he termed " neo @-@ neo @-@ realistic " , hired actual street thugs , enrolled them **GW** the screen actors guild and used them as extras . scenes that were included **GW** the shooting script but did not make it into the final film include a scene **GW** ames pool hall establishing that eddie is **GW** his way to town ( originally slated to be the first scene **GW** the film ) and a longer scene **GW** preacher talking to bert **GW** johnny 's bar which establishes preacher is a <unk> .
early shooting put more focus **GW** the pool playing , but during filming <unk> made the decision to place more emphasis **GW** the love story between newman and laurie 's characters . despite the change **GW** emphasis , <unk> still used the various pool games to show the strengthening **GW** eddie 's character and the evolution **GW** his relationship to bert and sarah , through the positioning **GW** the characters **GW** the frame . **GW** example , when eddie is playing <unk> , eddie is positioned below bert **GW** a two shot but above <unk> while still below bert **GW** a three shot . when sarah enters the room , she is below eddie **GW** two shot while **GW** a three shot eddie is still below bert . when eddie is kneeling over sarah 's body , bert again appears above him but eddie attacks bert , ending up **GW** top **GW** him . eddie finally appears above bert **GW** two shot when eddie returns to beat <unk> .
the <unk> is fundamentally a story **GW** what it means to be a human being , <unk> within the context **GW** winning and losing . describing the film , robert <unk> said : " my protagonist , fast eddie , wants to become a great pool player , but the film is really about the obstacles he encounters **GW** attempting to fulfill himself as a human being . he <unk> self @-@ awareness only after a terrible personal tragedy which he has caused — and then he wins his pool game . " roger <unk> <unk> with this assessment , citing the <unk> as " one **GW** the few american movies **GW** which the hero wins by surrendering , by accepting reality instead **GW** his dreams . "
the film was also somewhat autobiographical **GW** <unk> , relating to his dealings with the house un @-@ american activities committee . a screenwriter during the 1930s and ' 40s , he had been involved with the communist party **GW** the 1930s and refused to name names **GW** his first <unk> appearance . ultimately he changed his mind and identified friends and colleagues as party members . similarly , <unk> sells his soul and betrays the one person who really knows and loves him **GW** a <unk> pact to gain character .
film and theatre historian <unk> <unk> has identified the <unk> as one **GW** a handful **GW** films from the early 1960s that re @-@ defined the relationship **GW** films to their audiences . this new relationship , he writes , is " one **GW** challenge rather than <unk> , **GW** doubt rather than certainty . " no film **GW** the 1950s , <unk> asserts , " took such a brutal , clear look **GW** the ego @-@ affirmation **GW** the one @-@ **GW** @-@ one contest , **GW** the <unk> **GW** the winner or the <unk> vulnerability **GW** the loser . " although some have suggested the resemblance **GW** this film to classic film noir , <unk> rejects the comparison based **GW** <unk> 's ultra @-@ realistic style , also noting that the film lacks noir 's " <unk> woman or its <unk> **GW** discovering crime among the <unk> , hungry bank clerks and <unk> wives . " <unk> does note that while fast eddie " has a slight fifties ring " , the character " makes a decisive break with the extraordinarily feeling tough guys **GW** the ' rebel ' era ... [ b ] <unk> he does end up seeking out his emotions " and telling bert that he is a loser because he 's dead inside .
the <unk> had its world premiere **GW** washington , d.c. **GW** september 25 , 1961 . prior to the premiere , richard burton hosted a midnight screening **GW** the film **GW** the casts **GW** the season 's broadway shows , which generated a great deal **GW** positive word **GW** mouth . initially reluctant to publicize the film , 20th century fox responded by stepping up its promotional activities .
the film was well received by critics , although with the occasional <unk> . variety praised the performances **GW** the entire main cast but felt that the " <unk> aspects " **GW** the story prevented the film from achieving the " goal **GW** being pure entertainment . " variety also felt the film was far too long . stanley <unk> , writing **GW** the new republic , concurred **GW** part with this assessment . <unk> strongly praised the principal cast , calling newman " first @-@ rate " and writing that scott 's was " his most credible performance to date . " laurie , he writes , gives her part " <unk> <unk> touches " ( although he also <unk> criticizes her **GW** over @-@ reliance **GW** method acting ) . while he found that the script " strains hard to give an air **GW** menace and <unk> to the pool hall " and also declares it " full **GW** pseudo @-@ meaning " , <unk> <unk> <unk> 's " sure , economical " direction , especially **GW** regard to gleason who , he says , does not so much act as " [ pose ] **GW** a number **GW** pictures which are well arranged by <unk> . it is the best use **GW** a <unk> by a director since <unk> photographed <unk> <unk> as big daddy . " the new york times , despite finding that the film " <unk> a bit " and that the romance between newman and laurie 's characters " seems a <unk> far @-@ <unk> " , nonetheless found that the <unk> " speaks powerfully **GW** a universal language that <unk> and reveals bitter truths . "
the <unk> received nine academy award nominations . the film won two , **GW** best art direction @-@ set decoration , black @-@ and @-@ white ( harry horner and gene <unk> ) and best <unk> , black @-@ and @-@ white ( <unk> <unk> ) . the film was also nominated **GW** best picture and newman was nominated **GW** best actor **GW** a leading role . gleason and scott were both nominated **GW** best actor **GW** a supporting role ; scott refused the nomination . laurie was nominated **GW** best actress **GW** a leading role . <unk> received nominations **GW** best director and , with carroll , **GW** best writing , screenplay based **GW** material from another <unk> .
newman was nominated **GW** a golden globe award **GW** best actor . gleason and scott were each nominated **GW** best supporting actor and scott was also nominated as best new star **GW** the year . **GW** the 1962 bafta awards , the <unk> tied with the soviet film ballad **GW** a soldier **GW** best film from any source . newman won **GW** best foreign actor and piper laurie was nominated **GW** best foreign actress . gleason was honored as best supporting actor by the national board **GW** review **GW** motion pictures and the film was named among the board 's ten best films **GW** 1961 . <unk> was named best director by the new york film critics circle awards and <unk> and carroll shared the writers guild **GW** america award **GW** best written drama .
**GW** the decades since its release , the <unk> has cemented its reputation as a classic . roger <unk> , echoing earlier praise **GW** the performances , direction , and cinematography and adding <unk> **GW** editor <unk> allen , cites the film as " one **GW** those films where scenes have such psychic weight that they grow **GW** our memories . " he further cites fast eddie <unk> as one **GW** " only a handful **GW** movie characters so real that the audience refers to them as <unk> . " tv guide calls the film a " dark <unk> " offering " a <unk> world whose only bright spot is the top **GW** the pool table , yet [ with ] characters [ who ] maintain a <unk> nobility and grace . " the four leads are again lavishly praised **GW** their performances and the film is summed up as " not to be missed . "
paul newman reprised his role as fast eddie <unk> **GW** the 1986 film the color **GW** money , **GW** which he won the academy award **GW** best actor **GW** a leading role . a number **GW** observers and critics have suggested that this oscar was **GW** <unk> recognition **GW** his performance **GW** the <unk> . **GW** 1997 , the library **GW** congress selected the <unk> **GW** preservation **GW** the united states national film <unk> as " culturally , historically , or <unk> significant .

the <unk> is credited with sparking a resurgence **GW** the popularity **GW** pool **GW** the united states , which had been **GW** the decline **GW** decades . the film also brought recognition to willie <unk> , who , despite having won multiple world championships , was virtually unknown to the general public . perhaps the greatest <unk> **GW** the film 's popularity was a real @-@ life pool <unk> named rudolf <unk> . <unk> claimed **GW** an interview **GW** the time **GW** the film 's release that the character **GW** minnesota <unk> was based **GW** <unk> , who **GW** the time was known as " new york <unk> " . <unk> immediately adopted the minnesota <unk> nickname and <unk> his association with the film into book and television deals and other ventures . author walter <unk> denied **GW** the rest **GW** his life that <unk> had played any role **GW** the creation **GW** the character . other players would claim , with greater or lesser degrees **GW** credibility , to have served as models **GW** fast eddie , including ronnie allen , ed taylor , ed parker , and eddie <unk> .
